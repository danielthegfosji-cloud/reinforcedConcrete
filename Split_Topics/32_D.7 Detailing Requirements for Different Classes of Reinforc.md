# D.7 Detailing Requirements for Different Classes of Reinforced Concrete Moment Frames

Ordinary moment frames that are part of the seismic force—resisting system are permitted only in SDC  $\rm B^5$  and must meet seismic design and detailing requirements for beams and columns as prescribed in ACI 318, Chapter 21. Beams must have at least two of their longitudinal bars continuous along both the top and bottom faces, and these bars must be developed at the faces of supports. Such bars provide the frame with seismic load—resisting capability that may not have been required by analysis. Columns with clear height less than or equal to five times the dimension  $c_1$  must be designed for shear in accordance with ACI Section 21.3.3. The term  $c_1$  is the dimension of a rectangular (or equivalent rectangular column, capital, or bracket) in the direction of the span for which moments are being calculated. The design shear is determined as the summation of the moment capacity at the faces of the joints at each end of the column, divided by the distance between those faces. This approach, referred to as capacity design for shear, is intended to ensure that the columns do not fail in shear during an earthquake. If the moment capacity of a column is larger than that required based on analysis (due, for example, to reinforcing bars with cross-sectional areas greater than the theoretically required areas), then the shear capacity of the column must be correspondingly increased. This increased

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>5</sup> ASCE/SEI 7-10, Table 12.2-1.

design shear need not exceed the shear corresponding to a value of earthquake load E twice that required by the applicable code, however.

Intermediate moment frames that are part of the seismic force-resisting system are permitted in SDC B and C<sup>5</sup> only and must satisfy the more stringent requirements of ACI 318 Section 21.3. These include the shear requirements of ACI 21.3.3 described previously for certain columns in ordinary moment frames. In addition, beams (members with axial compressive loads,  $P_{\mu}$ , less than  $A_{\varrho}f_{c}^{\prime}/10$ ) must be designed for shear using capacity design as required in ACI 318 Section 21.3.4 and illustrated in Figure D.2. Beams must also be detailed for ductility, using closed spirals, closed hoops, or closed rectangular ties to confine the concrete so that it will be stronger and more ductile. Members with larger values of  $P_{\mu}$  must meet the requirements for columns in ACI 318 Section 21.3.5. These also include more stringent requirements for concrete confinement.

Special moment frames are permitted in any seismic design category (ASCE 7-10, Table 12.2-1) and must satisfy ACI 318 Sections 21.5 through 21.8. ACI 318 Section 21.5 applies only to flexural members in special moment frames. As with intermediate moment frames, a flexural member in a special moment frame is defined as one having a factored axial compressive force on the member,  $P_u$ , that does not exceed  $A_{\varrho}f_c'/10$ . Such a flexural member must have a clear span,  $l_n$ , not less than four times its effective depth. Its width,  $b_w$ , cannot be less than the smaller of 0.3h and 10 in. Additionally its width,  $b_w$ , must not exceed the width of the supporting member,  $c_2$ , plus a distance on each side of supporting member equal to the smaller of (a) the width of supporting member,  $c_2$ , and (b) 0.75 times the overall dimension of supporting member, c<sub>1</sub>. These geometric limits are intended to provide greater ductility. A limit of 0.025 is imposed on the longitudinal reinforcement ratio, to enhance flexural ductility and avoid congestion. A minimum of two bars must be provided continuously at both top and bottom. The positive moment strength at any joint face must be at least one-half the negative moment strength of the flexural member. The negative and the positive moment strength at any section along the member length must be at least one-fourth of the maximum moment strength provided at the face of either joint.

FIGURE D.2 Column and beam design shear for intermediate moment frames.

Lap splices of flexural reinforcement are permitted only if confinement reinforcement (hoops or spiral reinforcement) is provided over the entire lap length. The spacing of such transverse reinforcement cannot exceed the smaller of *d*/4 and 4 in. Lap splices are not permitted in regions where flexural yielding is expected, including

- **(a)** within the joints
- **(b)** within a distance of two times the member depth from the face of the joint
- **(c)** where analysis shows flexural yielding caused by inelastic lateral displacements of the frame

Requirements for transverse confinement are similar to but more stringent than those for intermediate concrete moment frames. They are intended to provide confinement of the concrete within the hoop and to provide lateral support to resist buckling of yielded longitudinal reinforcement under reversed cyclic loading. Hoops are required in regions expected to experience hinging. Where hoops are not required, stirrups having seismic hooks at both ends must be provided, spaced at a distance not more than *d*/2 throughout the length of the member.

Members of special moment frame must be designed for shear using the capacity design procedures explained above. When members of special moment frames are subjected to combined flexure and factored axial compressive forces exceeding *Ag f <sup>c</sup>*/10, additional requirements must be met. Geometric requirements include the following:

- **1.** The smallest cross-sectional dimension, measured on a line passing through the geometric centroid, must be at least 12 in.
- **2.** The ratio of the shortest cross-sectional dimension to the perpendicular dimension must be at least 0.4 in.

ACI 318 Section 21.6.2 requires that columns of special moment frames be designed so that their nominal flexural strengths are 20% stronger than those of the beams framing into a beam–column joint. This requirement is intended to ensure that if hinges should form at a beam–column joint, they would occur in beams rather than columns. If hinges form in columns, the result may be collapse of the frame. This requirement is waived if the columns' lateral strength and stiffness are ignored in determining the structure's strength and stiffness, such as in a braced frame.

The longitudinal reinforcement in columns of special moment frames must be between 1% and 6% of the gross cross-sectional area. In addition, lap splices must meet the requirements in ACI 318 Section 21.6.3.2.

Transverse reinforcement requirements (ACI 318 Section 21.6.4) for special moment frames are more stringent than those for ordinary or intermediate moment frames, and are intended to provide even higher ductility.

Shear requirements for intermediate moment frames are increased for special moment frames by changing *Mnl* and *Mnr* in Figure D.2 to *Mpr*<sup>1</sup> and *Mpr*2, respectively. *Mpr* is the probable flexural strength at the face of the joint considering axial load, if any, using a reinforcing steel stress of 1.25*fy* and a φ factor of 1.0. The subscripts 1 and 2 on *Mpr* denote the left and right ends of the flexural member, respectively. Similarly, the moments *Mnt* and *Mnb* in Figure D.2 are changed to *Mpr*<sup>3</sup> and *Mpr*4, where the subscripts 3 and 4 denote the top and bottom of the column, respectively. While Chapter 21 of ACI 318 contains additional requirements for shear strength and development length in tension in special moment frames, these are more complex than necessary for this introductory text in reinforced concrete design. Additional information on these and other seismic design provisions for reinforced concrete structures is provided in Chapter 29 of PCA's Notes on ACI 318-11, Chapter 29.

### Example D.1

Determine the design lateral forces due to earthquake on a 6-story concrete frame hospital using the equivalent lateral force procedure. The structure is selected as a hospital to illustrate the use of importance factors in calculating seismic design loads using the procedures of ASCE/SEI 7-10. Some states have additional requirements for hospitals, which are not addressed by this example. The structure is located in Memphis, Tennessee, for which MCE values are determined from USGS maps to be *SS* = 2.0 and *S*<sup>1</sup> = 0.9. The structure is located on soil determined to be site class C. Each floor is 12 ft in height. The value of *W* for each floor is determined to be 450 k, and for the roof, 200 k.

**1.** Determine *Fa* and *Fv*

From Table D.1(a), using *SS* ≥ 1.25 and site class C, *Fa* = 1.0.

From Table D.1(b), using *S*<sup>1</sup> ≥ 0.5 and site class C, *Fv* = 1.3.

**2.** Determine *SMS* and *SM*<sup>1</sup>

$$S_{MS} = F_a S_S = (1.0)(2.0) = 2.0$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 11.4-1)

$$S_{M1} = F_v S_1 = (1.3)(0.9) = 1.17$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 11.4-2)

**3.** Determine *SDS* and *SD*<sup>1</sup> (Table D.1)

$$S_{DS} = \frac{2S_{MS}}{3} = 1.33$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 11.4-3)

$$S_{D1} = \frac{2S_{M1}}{3} = 0.78$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 11.4-4)

- **4.** Risk and seismic importance factors—Table D.2 lists the risk category for hospitals as IV. This corresponds to a seismic importance factor of 1.5, also from the same table. This is a critical facility that requires the highest level of consideration, hence the highest importance factor. Imagine the consequences if our fire stations, police stations, and hospitals could not function after a serious earthquake.
- **5.** Determine the seismic design category—Table D.3(a) requires SDC D for *SDS* ≥ 0.50 and risk category IV. Table D.3(b) likewise requires SDC D for *SD*<sup>1</sup> ≥ 0.20 and risk category IV.
- **6.** Determine the response modification coefficient, *R*—Since a special moment frame is required for SDC D, *R* = 8 from Table D.4. Note that the frame must be detailed in accordance with the requirements for special moment frames.
- **7.** Determine the fundamental period of the structure—The approximate value of *T* is

$$T_a = 0.1N = 0.1(6) = 0.6 \text{ sec}$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 12.8-8)

(for frames with floor-to-floor heights exceeding 10 ft and with fewer than 12 stories)

**8.** Determine *TS* and *TL*

$$T_{S} = \frac{S_{D1}}{S_{DS}} = \frac{0.78}{1.33} = 0.59$$

*TL* = 12 (ASCE/SEI 7-10, Figure 22-12)

9. Determine the total design lateral seismic force on the structure

$$C_S = \frac{S_{DS}}{R/I} = \frac{1.33}{8/1.5} = 0.25$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 12.8-2)

and since  $T_a < T_L$ ,  $C_S$  need not exceed

$$C_{\rm S} = \frac{S_{D1}}{T(R/I)} = \frac{0.78}{0.6(8/1.5)} = 0.244$$
 (ASCE/SEI Equation 12.8-3)

the controlling value is  $C_S = 0.244$ .

$$V = C_S W = (0.244) (450 \text{ k}) (5 \text{ floors}) + (0.244) (200 \text{ k}) (1) = 598 \text{ kips}$$
(ASCE/SEI Equation 12.8-1)

The force at the top floor (roof level) is determined using Equation 12.8-12 of ASCE/SEI 7-10.

$$F_R = \frac{w_r h_R^{1.05}}{\sum_{i=1}^n w_i h_i^{1.05}} V$$

$$= \frac{(200 \text{ k}) (72 \text{ ft})^{1.05}}{(450 \text{ k}) (12 \text{ ft})^{1.05} + (450 \text{ k}) (24 \text{ ft})^{1.05} + \dots + (200 \text{ k}) (72 \text{ ft})^{1.05}} (598 \text{ k})$$

$$= \frac{17,833 \text{ ft-k}}{115,333 \text{ ft-k}} (598 \text{ k}) = 92.4 \text{ k}$$

The coefficient k is determined to be 1.05 by interpolation, using a value of T = 0.6 sec. At the fifth-floor level

$$F_{6} = \frac{w_{6}h_{6}^{1.05}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}h_{i}^{1.05}}V$$

$$= \frac{(450 \text{ k}) (60 \text{ ft})^{1.05}}{(450 \text{ k}) (12 \text{ ft})^{1.05} + (450 \text{ k}) (24 \text{ ft})^{1.05} + \dots + (200 \text{ k}) (72 \text{ ft})^{1.05}}(598 \text{ k})$$

$$= \frac{33,134 \text{ ft-k}}{115,333 \text{ ft-k}}(598 \text{ k}) = 171.8 \text{ k}$$

The remaining forces at other floor levels are calculated using the technique shown above for the roof and sixth levels, and the results are shown in Figure D.3.

**FIGURE D.3** Design lateral seismic forces for Example D.1.

#### Example D.2

Determine the design column shear for the column in Figure D.4 if it is part of an intermediate concrete moment frame.

Determine the moment capacity of the column.

#### SOLUTION

$$K_n = \frac{P_n}{f'_c A_g} = \frac{P_u}{\phi f'_c A_g} = \frac{120 \text{ k}}{0.65(4 \text{ ksi}) (16 \text{ in.})^2} = 0.18$$

$$\rho_z = \frac{6 \text{ in.}^2}{(16 \text{ in.})^2} = 0.0234$$

Using the Column Interaction diagrams in Appendix A, Graph 3,  $R_n = 0.18$ . However, the location of the coordinates of  $K_n$  and  $R_n$  appears to be on the radial line corresponding to  $\epsilon_t = 0.005$ . The  $\phi$  factor for this value of  $K_n$  and  $R_n$  is 0.9, not 0.65 as assumed above. Repeating the calculation of  $K_n$  using  $\phi = 0.9$  results in  $K_n = 0.130$ . From Graph 3,  $R_n = 0.17$ .

$$M_n = R_n f'_c A_a h = 0.17(4 \text{ ksi}) (16 \text{ in.})^2 (16 \text{ in.}) = 2785 \text{ in-k} = 232.1 \text{ ft-k}$$

Since the moment capacities at the top and bottom of the column are the same,  $M_{nt}$  $M_{nh} = 232.1 \text{ ft-k}.$ 

$$V_u = \frac{M_{nt} + M_{nb}}{I_u} = \frac{232.1 \text{ ft-k} + 232.1 \text{ ft-k}}{12 \text{ ft}} = 38.68 \text{ k}$$

FIGURE D.4 Details for Example D.2.

#### Example D.3

The beam–column joint shown in Figure D.5 is part of a special moment frame. Determine if the joint is in compliance with ACI 318-11 Section 21.6.2.2. If not, redesign the columns to comply with this provision.

#### SOLUTION

ACI 318-11 Section 21.6.2.2 requires that the sum of the column moments at a joint  $(M_{nt} + M_{nb})$  be not less than 120% of the sum of the beam moments framing into the same joint  $(M_{nl} + M_{nr})$ . The axial force is included in determining the column's flexural capacity.

Beam capacity: The beam cross section at the left side of the joint is subjected to positive moment. Hence,  $A_s = 4$  in.<sup>2</sup> and  $A'_s = 1.57$  in.<sup>2</sup>

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.85 f_c b} = \frac{4.00 \text{ in.}^2 \times 60 \text{ ksi}}{0.85 \times 4 \text{ ksi} \times 14 \text{ in.}} = 5.04 \text{ in.}$$

$$M_n = A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right) = 4.00 \text{ in.}^2 \times 60 \text{ ksi} \times \left( 17.5 \text{ in.} - \frac{5.04 \text{ in.}}{2} \right) = 3595 \text{ in-k}$$

*Note:* If the compression steel ( $A'_s = 1.57 \text{ in.}^2$ ) were included, the moment capacity would be 3710 in-k (only 3% more).

The beam cross section at the right side of the joint is subjected to negative moment. Hence,  $A_s=1.57~\rm{in.^2}$  and  $A_s'=4.00~\rm{in.^2}$ 

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.85 f_c b} = \frac{1.57 \text{ in.}^2 \times 60 \text{ ksi}}{0.85 \times 4 \text{ ksi} \times 14 \text{ in.}} = 1.98 \text{ in.}$$

$$M_n = A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right) = 1.57 \text{ in.}^2 \times 60 \text{ ksi} \times \left( 17.5 \text{ in.} - \frac{1.98 \text{ in.}}{2} \right) = 1555 \text{ in-k}$$

*Note:* If the compression steel ( $A'_s = 4.00 \text{ in.}^2$ ) were included, the moment capacity would be 1558 in-k (only 0.2% more).

![](_page_716_Figure_12.jpeg)

**FIGURE D.5** Details for Example D.3.

Column capacity: Using the interaction diagrams in Appendix A, the moment capacity corresponding to an axial compressive load of 300 kips is determined as follows:

Assume 
$$\phi = 0.65$$
.  $\rho_z = A_{st}/bh = 10$  in.<sup>2</sup>/(16 in.) (18 in.) = 0.035.

$$K_n = \frac{P_u}{\phi f_c' b h} = \frac{300 \text{ k}}{0.65 \text{ k} \times 4 \text{ ksi} \times 16 \text{ in.} \times 18 \text{ in.}} = 0.40$$

$$\gamma = \frac{h - 5 \text{ in.}}{h} = \frac{13 \text{ in.}}{18 \text{ in}} = 0.72$$
 (use Graph 7,  $\gamma = 0.7$ )

$$R_p = 0.22$$
,  $M_p = R_p f_c' b h^2 = 0.22(4.0 \text{ ksi})(16 \text{ in.})(18 \text{ in.})^2 = 4562 \text{ in-k}$ 

Also from Graph 7,  $f_s/f_v$  is between 0.9 and 1.0, which means  $\epsilon_t < \epsilon_v$  and  $\phi = 0.65$ , as assumed.

The columns above and below the joint have the same axial load and same cross section, hence the same capacity. If the axial load of the column below had been different from that above, the moment capacity would be different, even with the same cross section. The sum of the nominal column moment capacities at the joint is therefore (2)(4562 in-k) = 9124 in-k. The sum of the nominal beam moment capacities is 3595 in-k + 1555 in-k = 5150 in-k. Since 9124 in-k > 1.2 × 5150 in-k = 6180 in-k, the strong-column, weak-beam requirements of Chapter 21 of ACI 318-11 for special moment frames are satisfied.
