# **CHA PTER 20** Reinforced Concrete Masonry

### **20.1 Introduction**

Masonry is the assemblage of masonry units (brick or concrete block), mortar, and sometimes grout (sort of a soupy concrete) and, if the masonry is reinforced, reinforcing. Concrete masonry is masonry constructed with concrete block or, more accurately, concrete masonry units, or CMUs. Masonry can be either reinforced or unreinforced, but this chapter is limited to reinforced masonry. It can also be designed by allowable stress design or strength design, but this chapter is limited to strength design. Masonry design and construction is governed by *Building Code Requirements and Specification for Masonry Structures* (ACI 530/ACI 530.1)<sup>1</sup> and, in many jurisdictions, the *International Building Code* (IBC).2 These codes change every three years on a similar schedule to that of the ACI 318 code.

### **20.2 Masonry Materials**

### **Concrete Masonry Units**

Properties of concrete masonry units are governed by ASTM C90. This specification applies to hollow and solid load-bearing CMUs ordinarily used in the construction of concrete masonry. The standard limits the thickness of face shells and webs according to the wall thickness of the units. A good source of information on CMUs is published by the National Concrete Masonry Association<sup>3</sup> (ncma.org) in the NCMA TEK series. See NCMA TEK 1-1E (2007) for more on CMU standards. Other requirements for CMUs are unit compressive strength (1900 psi average for three units, 1700 psi minimum for a single unit). For example, if three CMUs are tested for net area compressive strength and the results are 1750 psi, 1920 psi, and 2010 psi, the test would fail. Although no test value falls below 1700 psi, the average of these values is 1893 psi, which is below 1900 psi. Rarely is it necessary to specify a compressive strength greater than the minimum value, and cost and availability of units with higher strengths are sometimes a problem if a higher strength is specified.

ASTM C90<sup>4</sup> also limits the maximum water absorption of units. Absorption is a measure of the total water required to fill all voids within the net volume of concrete. It is determined from the weight-per-unit-volume difference between saturated and oven-dry concrete masonry units. Lightweight units are permitted higher absorption values than medium- or normal-weight units because their aggregates absorb more water.

Unit dimensions are given in terms of *nominal* values. That is, a CMU with nominal dimensions of 8 in.  $\times$  8 in.  $\times$  16 in. is actually  $7\frac{5}{8}$  in.  $\times$   $7\frac{5}{8}$  in.  $\times$  15 $\frac{5}{8}$  in. When a  $\frac{3}{8}$ -in. mortar-joint thickness is added to the actual dimension, the result is the nominal dimension.

Finally, the drying shrinkage of CMUs is limited to 0.065%, according to ASTM C426, Test Method for Linear Drying Shrinkage of Concrete Masonry Units. If CMUs shrink too much when they dry, walls constructed from them will be more likely to undergo shrinkage cracks.

#### Mortar

The question is often asked, Does mortar hold masonry units apart or hold them together? Actually, mortar does both. It allows the mason to lay irregular masonry units into a wall that has character, texture, and longevity. Mortar joints are usually  $\frac{3}{8}$  in. thick, but the bricklayer can vary their thickness to accommodate variations of unit dimensions. So in this sense, mortar holds units apart. Mortar also holds units together by bonding units to each other, resulting in both flexural and direct tensile strength. For reinforced masonry, such tensile strength is not as important as it is for unreinforced masonry, but it is still important. Mortar is placed on the masonry units with a hand trowel. The horizontal joints, called bed joints, are usually laid in "face-shell" bedding. This means that the mortar is placed only on the face shells, not the webs. The vertical joints in masonry construction are called head joints. These joints are not usually filled completely with mortar either. They are usually filled only to a depth about equal to the thickness of the face shells on both faces of the wall.

Mortar is specified under ASTM C270.5 There are three cementitious systems included in this standard: cement and lime, masonry cement, and mortar cement. Cement lime mortar consists of a mixture of cement (e.g., portland cement, blended cement), hydrated lime (soft, white powder, Ca(OH)2, obtained by the action of water on lime), sand, water, and sometimes admixtures. Masonry cements are a blend of portland or other cements, plasticizing agents, fillers, and other materials that are intended to enhance the performance of the mortar. Limits are placed on its air content, especially when it is used in reinforced masonry. Mortar cement is a superior masonry cement that is required to meet additional flexural bond strength requirements not expected of masonry cement. As a result, mortar cement is permitted in high seismic areas (seismic design categories D and higher), unlike masonry cement.

Mortar is classified into types. The mortar types are designated M, S, N, O, and K. This odd set of letters actually comes from every second letter of the words MASON WORK. Type M mortar is the strongest, followed by Type S and Type N. Type O and Type K mortars are not included in the ACI 530 Code. Type M mortar, while being the strongest, is not the best choice for most masonry construction. The vast majority of masonry is constructed from Type S or Type N mortar. Type S or Type M is required for seismic design categories D (SDC D) and higher.

Mortar is specified either by proportion or by property, but not both. If the designer does not specify which of these he or she is using, the default is by proportion. Specifying by proportion is analogous to baking a cake from a recipe. The type and quantity of ingredients are specified, but the end result (such as how it tastes) is not. ASTM C270 gives the type and quantity of ingredients for each type of mortar. For example, Type N cement lime mortar has one part cement, one part lime, and from  $2\frac{1}{4}$  to 3 times the volume of cementitious materials of sand. The sand is specified under ASTM C144. If the upper limit of three parts of sand is chosen, then an acceptable "recipe" for Type N mortar is 1 ft<sup>3</sup> of cement, 1 ft<sup>3</sup> of hydrated lime, and 6 ft<sup>3</sup> of sand. An experienced mason would call this a 1:1:6 mix. NCMA TEK 9-1A gives more detail on mortar, including how to select, specify, and construct with it.

#### Grout

Masonry grout is specified under ASTM C476. Grout consists of cement, sand, and water and may also include lime, coarse aggregates, or admixtures. The most common application of masonry grout is in reinforced masonry to bond the masonry to the reinforcing steel. Hollow CMUs have large cells (approximately 4-in. square) into which reinforcing bars can be placed and the remaining void space subsequently filled with grout. Because the masonry unit is absorptive, the grout must have a higher slump than concrete. The grout that is placed in the cells experiences suction from the walls of the units, and water is lost from the grout mix. If the grout is not "soupy" to start with, then it will not fill the void spaces properly. If you visit a construction site just after the grout is placed in a masonry wall, the moisture that is absorbed into the masonry units will be clearly visible on the outside of the wall. The units will be a darker gray because of the absorption of the water. Cases have been reported where this observation resulted in the realization that grout was not flowing to the bottom of the grout pour because of the absence of the change in CMU coloration.

Most concrete is placed with a slump of 3 in. to 5 in. Masonry grout, however, is placed with a slump of 8 in. to 11 in. Keep in mind that the slump test is performed with a cone that is only 12 in. tall, so an 11-in. slump is quite high (wet). Many engineers are alarmed by this because of their experience with concrete. It is important that the engineer realize that grout must have a high slump in order to be placed and consolidated properly. The water–cement ratio will be reduced when the units absorb some of the water from the grout, and the grout will be much stronger as a result. After grout is placed in the cells to the grout lift height, an immersible vibrator is used to consolidate it. Often, when grout is placed to its final height to the top of a wall, the top surface of the grout will recede as much as 1 in. after it is vibrated. This is caused by a combination of the vibration consolidating the grout and the CMUs absorbing a portion of the water in the grout.

#### Reinforcing

The reinforcing bars used in reinforced masonry construction are the same as those used in reinforced concrete. See Section 1.16 of this text for a discussion of reinforcing bars. However, joint reinforcing is unique to masonry. Joint reinforcing is specified under ASTM A951. It is usually galvanized for corrosion protection. Its role is mostly for control of shrinkage cracks; however, it can be included as part of the reinforcing in shear walls in allowable stress design. Since it cannot be included in strength design, it will not be considered further in this discussion.

Reinforcing bars are placed in the hollow cells of walls made of hollow CMUs. They are placed vertically for walls that span vertically. The use of spacers is recommended to ensure the correct location of the bars within the wall. Most walls have a single layer of reinforcing, hence the bars are located in the center of the wall. This is quite different from concrete beams, for example, where the steel is placed near the tension surface for greater efficiency. Most masonry walls are subjected to wind or earthquake loads that are reversible. Placing the steel off-center in such a wall would be effective for wind pressure but ineffective for wind suction. If a wall has a lateral load that is not reversible, such as an earth retaining wall, then placing the steel off-center can prove to be more efficient. However, the designer must be sure the steel is placed off-center in the correct direction. Thicker walls (12 in. or more) may be reinforced with two layers of reinforcement, which is common practice in areas of high seismicity.

Reinforcing steel bars can also be placed horizontally in bond beams. These are used in walls that span horizontally, for example, between masonry columns embedded within masonry walls (called pilasters). Bond beams are also used to provide for shear reinforcement in shear walls. Most designers think of shear reinforcement as vertical stirrups. However, in shear walls, the direction of the shear force is horizontal, hence so is the shear reinforcement. This was also the case for concrete shear walls discussed in Chapter 18 of this text. Bond beams are usually constructed using CMUs that have webs that are not the full height of the unit. By having half-high webs, a horizontal space is created in a masonry wall, allowing for placement of the horizontal reinforcing steel. Often two bars are placed in a single bond beam. Since the vast majority of CMUs are 8 in. high, the vertical spacing of bond beams is a multiple of 8 in. For example, a wall might have horizontal bond beams, each containing two #5 bars, spaced in every fourth course, hence every 32 in. A course is simply a continuous horizontal layer of masonry units.

### **20.3 Specified Compressive Strength of Masonry**

The specified compressive strength of masonry, *f <sup>m</sup>*, is analogous to the specified compressive strength of concrete, *f <sup>c</sup>* . Many students, and even designers not familiar with masonry, confuse masonry unit strengths with *f <sup>m</sup>*. Unit strengths are the compressive strength of the units without the inclusion of mortar, grout, or reinforcement. Unit strengths are higher than *f <sup>m</sup>*. The most commonly specified value of *f <sup>m</sup>* is 1500 psi for concrete masonry. Compliance with the specified value can be demonstrated in two ways: the unit strength method or the prism test method. The prism test method requires the construction and testing of large test specimens, which is expensive and which could result in obtaining a low test result well after walls are finished. The most common method of determining compliance with *f <sup>m</sup>* is the unit strength method. In this method, the unit compressive strength and mortar type are used along with Table 2 in ACI 530.1 (shown as Table 20.1 below) to determine compliance.

As an example, if a 1900-psi unit compressive strength is specified along with Type S mortar, then the net area compressive strength of masonry is 1500 psi. The minimum compressive strength in ASTM C90 is 1900 psi, so this level of strength is obtained without specifying a higher-strength unit. If the designer has specified  $f'_m = 1500$  psi, then this combination of unit strength and mortar type would comply without testing prisms.

#### 20.4 Maximum Flexural Tensile Reinforcement

The masonry code (ACI 530 Section 3.3.3.5) limits the area of tensile reinforcing in order to ensure ductility. The provision is analogous to the ACI 318 philosophy of a tension-controlled section but not exactly the same. The masonry code does not vary the  $\phi$  factor as a penalty for not having a tension-controlled section. The maximum flexural tensile reinforcement provision applies only to members having  $M_u/(V_u d_v) \ge 1$ . Members with  $M_u/(V_u d_v) < 1$  are stocky members that are not controlled by flexure. This provision requires that the tensile strain in the reinforcing steel be at least 50% greater than the yield strain. This 50% factor corresponds to a ductility factor,  $\mu$ , of 1.5. For intermediate reinforced shear walls, the  $\mu$  factor is increased to  $\mu = 3$ , and for special reinforced shear walls,  $\mu = 4$ . Axial load, if present, must be included in this calculation. The axial load to be considered is  $D + 0.75L + 0.525Q_E$  where  $Q_E$  is the effect of horizontal seismic (earthquake-induced) forces. The effect of compression reinforcement, even without lateral restraining reinforcement, may be included when calculating maximum flexural tensile reinforcement. The impact of this provision is to limit the amount of reinforcing steel that can be placed in a masonry member. Axial compression reduces this maximum permitted amount. Alternatively, for a given amount of reinforcing steel, these provisions impose a limit on the amount of axial compression permitted. Examples of the application of this limit are included in the example problems for this chapter.
