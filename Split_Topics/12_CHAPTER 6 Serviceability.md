# **CHAPTER 6** Serviceability

### **6.1 Introduction**

Today the structural design profession is concerned with a *limit states* philosophy. The term *limit state* is used to describe a condition at which a structure or some part of a structure ceases to perform its intended function. There are two categories of limit states: strength and serviceability.

*Strength limit states* are based on the safety or load-carrying capacity of structures and include buckling, fracture, fatigue, overturning, and so on. Chapters 3 to 5 have been concerned with the bending limit state of various members.

*Serviceability limit states* refer to the performance of structures under normal service loads and are concerned with the uses and/or occupancy of structures. Serviceability is measured by considering the magnitudes of deflections, cracks, and vibrations of structures, as well as by considering the amounts of surface deterioration of the concrete and corrosion of the reinforcing. You will note that these items may disrupt the use of structures but do not usually involve collapse.

This chapter is concerned with serviceability limits for deflections and crack widths. The ACI Code contains very specific requirements relating to the strength limit states of reinforced concrete members but allows the designer some freedom of judgment in the serviceability areas. This doesn't mean that the serviceability limit states are not significant, but by far the most important consideration (as in all structural specifications) is the life and property of the public. As a result, public safety is not left up to the judgment of the individual designer.

Vertical vibration for bridge and building floors, as well as lateral and torsional vibration in tall buildings, can be quite annoying to users of these structures. Vibrations are not usually a problem in the average-size reinforced concrete building, but we should be on the lookout for the situations where they can be objectionable.

The deterioration of concrete surfaces can be greatly minimized by exercising good control of the mixing, placing, and curing of the concrete. When those surfaces are subjected to harsh chemicals, special cements with special additives can be used to protect the surfaces. The corrosion of reinforcing can be greatly minimized by giving careful attention to concrete quality, using good vibration of the concrete, using adequate cover thickness for the bars, and limiting crack sizes.

### **6.2 Importance of Deflections**

The adoption of the strength design method, together with the use of higher-strength concretes and steels, has permitted the use of relatively slender members. As a result, deflections and deflection cracking have become more severe problems than they were a few decades ago.

The magnitudes of deflections for concrete members can be quite important. Excessive deflections of beams and slabs may cause sagging floors, ponding on flat roofs, excessive vibrations, and even interference with the proper operation of supported machinery. Such

deflections may damage partitions and cause poor fitting of doors and windows. In addition, they may damage a structure's appearance or frighten the occupants of the building, even though the building may be perfectly safe. Any structure used by people should be quite rigid and relatively vibration-free so as to provide a sense of security.

Perhaps the most common type of deflection damage in reinforced concrete structures is the damage to light masonry partitions. They are particularly subject to damage because of concrete's long-term creep. When the floors above and below deflect, the relatively rigid masonry partitions do not bend easily and are often severely damaged. The more flexible gypsum board partitions are much more adaptable to such distortions.

### **6.3 Control of Deflections**

One of the best ways to reduce deflections is by increasing member depths—but designers are always under pressure to keep members as shallow as possible. (As you can see, shallower members mean thinner floors, and thinner floors mean buildings with less height, with consequent reductions in many costs, such as plumbing, wiring, elevators, outside materials on buildings, and so on.) Reinforced concrete specifications usually limit deflections by specifying certain minimum depths or maximum permissible computed deflections.

### **Minimum Thicknesses**

Table 4.1 in Chapter 4, which is Table 9.5(a) of the ACI Code, provides a set of minimum thicknesses for beams and one-way slabs to be used, unless actual deflection calculations indicate that lesser thicknesses are permissible. These minimum thickness values, which were developed primarily on the basis of experience over many years, should be used only for beams and slabs that are not supporting or attached to partitions or other members likely to be damaged by deflections.

<sup>∗</sup>Limit not intended to safeguard against ponding. Ponding should be checked by suitable calculations of deflection, including added deflections due to ponded water, and considering long-term effects of all sustained loads, camber, construction tolerances, and reliability of provisions for drainage.

### **Maximum Deflections**

If the designer chooses not to meet the minimum thicknesses given in Table 4.1, he or she must compute deflections. If this is done, the values determined may not exceed the values specified in Table 6.1, which is Table 9.5(b) of the ACI Code.

### **Camber**

The deflection of reinforced concrete members may also be controlled by cambering. The members are constructed of such a shape that they will assume their theoretical shape under some service loading condition (usually dead load and perhaps some part of the live load). A simple beam would be constructed with a slight convex bend, so that under certain gravity loads, it would become straight, as assumed in the calculations. (See Figure 6.1.) Some designers take into account both dead and full live loads in figuring the amount of camber. Camber is generally used only for longer-span members.

<sup>†</sup>Long-term deflection shall be determined in accordance with ACI Code 9.5.2.5 or 9.5.4.3 but may be reduced by the amount of deflection calculated to occur before attachment of nonstructured elements. This amount shall be determined on the basis of accepted engineering data relating to time-deflection characteristics of members similar to those being considered.

<sup>‡</sup>Limit may be exceeded if adequate measures are taken to prevent damage to supported or attached elements.

<sup>§</sup>But not greater than tolerance provided for nonstructural elements. Limit may be exceeded if camber is provided so that total deflection minus camber does not exceed limit.

### **6.4 Calculation of Deflections**

Deflections for reinforced concrete members can be calculated with the usual deflection expressions, several of which are shown in Figure 6.2. A few comments should be made about the magnitudes of deflections in concrete members as determined by the expressions given in this figure. It can be seen that the centerline deflection of a uniformly loaded simple beam [Figure 6.2(a)] is five times as large as the centerline deflection of the same beam if its ends are fixed [Figure 6.2(b)]. Nearly all concrete beams and slabs are continuous, and their deflections fall somewhere between the two extremes mentioned here.

Because of the very large deflection variations that occur with different end restraints, it is essential that those restraints be considered if realistic deflection calculations are to be made. For most practical purposes, it is sufficiently accurate to calculate the centerline deflection of a member as though it is simply supported and to subtract from that value the deflection caused by the average of the negative moments at the member ends. (This can be done by using a combination of expressions taken from Figure 6.2. For instance, the deflection equation of part (a) may be used together with the one of part (g) applied at one or both ends as necessary.) Loads used in these expressions are unfactored loads. In some cases, only the live load is considered; in others, both live and dead (sustained) loads are considered.

#### 6.5 **Effective Moments of Inertia**

Regardless of the method used for calculating deflections, there is a problem in determining the moment of inertia to be used. The trouble lies in the amount of cracking that has occurred. If the bending moment is less than the cracking moment (i.e., if the flexural stress is less than the modulus of rupture of about  $7.5\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}$ ), the full uncracked section provides rigidity, and the moment of inertia for the gross section  $I_g$  is available. When larger moments are present, different-size tension cracks occur and the position of the neutral axis varies.

Figure 6.3 illustrates the problem involved in selecting the moment of inertia to be used for deflection calculations. Although a reinforced concrete beam may be of constant size (or prismatic) throughout its length, for deflection calculations, it will behave as though it were composed of segments of different-size beams.<sup>1</sup>

For the portion of a beam where the moment is less than the cracking moment,  $M_{cr}$ , the beam can be assumed to be uncracked, and the moment of inertia can be assumed to equal  $I_e$ . When the moment is greater than  $M_{cr}$ , the tensile cracks that develop in the beam will, in effect, cause the beam cross section to be reduced, and the moment of inertia may be assumed to equal the transformed value, I<sub>cr</sub>. It is as though the beam consists of the segments shown in Figure 6.3(d).

The problem is even more involved than indicated by Figure 6.3. It is true that at cross sections where tension cracks are actually located, the moment of inertia is probably close to the transformed  $I_{cr}$ , but in between cracks, it is perhaps closer to  $I_g$ . Furthermore, diagonal tension cracks may exist in areas of high shear, causing other variations. As a result, it is difficult to decide what value of I should be used.

**FI GU RE 6.3** Effects of cracks on deflections.

A concrete section that is fully cracked on its tension side will have a rigidity of anywhere from one-third to three-fourths of its uncracked full section rigidity. At different sections along the beam, the rigidity varies depending on the moment present. It is easy to see that an accurate method of calculating deflections must take these variations into account.

If it is desired to obtain the immediate deflection of an uncracked prismatic member, the moment of inertia may be assumed to equal *Ig* along the length of the member. Should the member be cracked at one or more sections along its length, or if its depth varies along the span, a more exact value of *I* needs to be used.

Section 9.5.2.3 of the code gives a moment of inertia expression that is to be used for deflection calculations. This moment of inertia provides a transitional value between *Ig* and *Icr* that depends upon the extent of cracking caused by applied loads. It is referred to as *Ie*, the effective moment of inertia, and is based on an estimation of the probable amount of cracking caused by the varying moment throughout the span2:

$$I_e = \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_a}\right)^3 (I_g) + \left[1 - \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_a}\right)^3\right] I_{cr}$$
 (ACI Equation 9-8)

<sup>2</sup> Branson, D. E., 1965, "Instantaneous and Time-Dependent Deflections on Simple Continuous Reinforced Concrete Beams," HPR Report No. 7, Part 1, Alabama Highway Department, Bureau of Public Roads, August 1963, pp. 1–78.

In this expression,  $I_o$  is the gross amount of inertia (without considering the steel) of the section and  $M_{cr}$  is the cracking moment  $= f_r I_g/y_t$ , with  $f_r = 7.5 \lambda \sqrt{f_c'}$ . [3]  $M_a$  is the maximum service-load moment occurring for the condition under consideration, and  $I_{cr}$  is the transformed moment of inertia of the cracked section, as described in Section 2.3.

You will note that the values of the effective moment of inertia vary with different loading conditions. This is because the service-load moment,  $M_a$ , used in the equation for  $I_a$ , is different for each loading condition. Some designers ignore this fact and use only one  $I_{\rho}$  for each member, even though different loading conditions are considered. They feel that their computed values are just as accurate as those obtained with the different  $I_a$  values. It is true that the varying conditions involved in constructing reinforced concrete members (workmanship, curing conditions, age of members when loads were first applied, etc.) make the calculation of deflections by any present-day procedure a very approximate process.

In this chapter the authors compute  $I_e$  for each different loading condition. The work is a little tedious, but it can be greatly expedited with various tables, such as the ones provided in the ACI Design Handbook.<sup>4</sup>

### **Long-Term Deflections**

With  $I_e$  and the appropriate deflection expressions, instantaneous or immediate deflections are obtained. Long-term or sustained loads, however, cause significant increases in these deflections because of shrinkage and creep. The factors affecting deflection increases include humidity, temperature, curing conditions, compression steel content, ratio of stress to strength, and the age of the concrete at the time of loading.

If concrete is loaded at an early age, its long-term deflections will be greatly increased. Excessive deflections in reinforced concrete structures can very often be traced to the early application of loads. The creep strain after about five years (after which creep is negligible) may be as high as four or five times the initial strain when loads were first applied 7 to 10 days after the concrete was placed, while the ratio may only be two or three when the loads were first applied 3 or 4 months after concrete placement.

Because of the several factors mentioned in the last two paragraphs, the magnitudes of long-term deflections can only be estimated. The code (9.5.2.5) states that to estimate the increase in deflection due to these causes, the part of the instantaneous deflection that is due to sustained loads may be multiplied by the empirically derived factor  $\lambda$  at the end of this paragraph and the result added to the instantaneous deflection.<sup>5</sup>

$$\lambda_{\Delta} = \frac{\xi}{1 + 50\rho'}$$
 (ACI Equation 9-11)

In this expression, which is applicable to both normal- and lightweight concrete,  $\xi$  is a time-dependent factor that may be determined from Table 6.2.

Should times differing from the values given in Table 6.2 be used, values of  $\xi$  may be selected from the curve of Figure 6.4.

The effect of compression steel on long-term deflections is taken into account in the  $\lambda$ expression with the term  $\rho'$ . It equals  $A'_s/bd$  and is to be computed at midspan for simple and continuous spans, and at the supports for cantilevers.

The full dead load of a structure can be classified as a sustained load, but the type of occupancy will determine the percentage of live load that can be called sustained. For an

**TABLE 6.2** Time Factor for Sustained Loads (ACI Code 9.5.2.5)

apartment house or for an office building, perhaps only 20% to 25% of the service live load should be considered as being sustained, whereas perhaps 70% to 80% of the service live load of a warehouse might fall into this category.

A study by the ACI indicates that under controlled laboratory conditions, 90% of test specimens had deflections between 20% below and 30% above the values calculated by the method described in this chapter.6 The reader should realize, however, that field conditions are not lab conditions, and deflections in actual structures will vary much more than those occurring in the lab specimens. Despite the use of plans and specifications and field inspection, it is difficult to control fieldwork adequately. Construction crews may add a little water to the concrete to make it more workable. Further, they may not obtain satisfactory mixing and compaction of the concrete, with the result that voids and honeycomb occur. Finally, the forms may be removed before the concrete has obtained its full design strength. If this is the case, the moduli of rupture and elasticity will be low, and excessive cracks may occur in beams that would not have occurred if the concrete had been stronger. All of these factors can cause reinforced concrete structures to deflect appreciably more than is indicated by the usual computations.

It is logical to assume that the live load cannot act on a structure when the dead load is not present. As a result of this fact, we will compute an effective *Ie* and a deflection δ*<sup>D</sup>* for the case where the dead load alone is acting. Then we will compute an *Ie* and a deflection δ*D*+*<sup>L</sup>* for the case where both dead and live loads are acting. This will enable us to determine the initial live load part of the deflection as follows:

$$\delta_L = \delta_{D+L} - \delta_D$$

<sup>6</sup> ACI Committee 435, 1972, "Variability of Deflections of Simply Supported Reinforced Concrete Beams," *Journal ACI*, 69(1), p. 29.

The long-term deflection will equal the initial live load deflection,  $\delta_I$ , plus the infinitely long-term multiplier,  $\lambda_{\infty}$ , times the dead load deflection,  $\delta_D$ , plus  $\lambda_r$ , the live load sustained multiplier, times the initial live load deflection,  $\delta_{SL}$ .

$$\delta_{LT} = \delta_L + \lambda_{\infty} \delta_D + \lambda_t \delta_{SL}$$

The steps involved in calculating instantaneous and long-term deflections can be summarized as follows:

- (a) Compute the instantaneous or short-term deflection,  $\delta_D$ , for dead load only.
- (b) Compute instantaneous deflection,  $\delta_{D+L}$ , for dead plus full live load.
- (c) Determine instantaneous deflection,  $\delta_L$ , for full live load only.
- (d) Compute instantaneous deflection due to dead load plus the sustained part of the live load,  $\delta_D + \delta_{SL}$ .
- (e) Determine instantaneous deflection,  $\delta_L$ , for the part of the live load that is sustained.
- (f) Determine the long-term deflection for dead load plus the sustained part of the live load,  $\delta_{LT}$ .

As previously mentioned, the deflections calculated as described in this chapter should not exceed certain limits, depending on the type of structure. Maximum deflections permitted by the ACI for several floor and roof situations were presented in Table 6.1.

### Simple-Beam Deflections

Example 6.1 presents the calculation of instantaneous and long-term deflections for a uniformly loaded simple beam.

#### Example 6.1

The beam of Figure 6.5 has a simple span of 20 ft and supports a dead load including its own weight of 1 klf and a live load of 0.7 klf.  $f_c' = 3000$  psi.

- (a) Calculate the instantaneous deflection for D + L.
- (b) Calculate the deflection assuming that 30% of the live load is continuously applied for three years.

**FIGURE 6.5** Beam cross section for Example 6.1.

#### **SOLUTION**

### **(a) Instantaneous or Short-Term Dead Load Deflection (***δD***)**

$$I_g = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (12 \text{ in.})(20 \text{ in.})^3 = 8000 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$M_{cr} = \frac{f_r I_g}{y_t} = \frac{(7.5\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}) (8000 \text{ in.}^4)}{10 \text{ in.}} = 328,633 \text{ in-lb} = 27.4 \text{ ft-k}$$

$$M_a = \frac{(1.0 \text{ kif}) (20 \text{ ft})^2}{8} = 50 \text{ ft-k} = M_D$$

Should the dead load moment, *MD*, be less than the cracking moment, *Mcr*, we should use *Mcr* = *Ma* and *I <sup>e</sup>* = *I g*.

By transformed-area calculations, the values of *x* and *Icr* can be determined as previously illustrated in Example 2.3.

$$x = 6.78 \text{ in.}$$
 $I_{cr} = 4067 \text{ in.}^4$ 

Then *I <sup>e</sup>* is calculated with ACI Equation 9-8:

$$\begin{split} I_e &= \left(\frac{27.4 \text{ ft-k}}{50 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3 (8000 \text{ in.}^4) + \left[1 - \left(\frac{27.4 \text{ ft-k}}{50 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3\right] 4067 \text{ in.}^4 = 4714 \text{ in.}^4 \\ E_c &= 57,000\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi} = 3.122 \times 10^6 \text{ psi} \\ \delta_D &= \frac{5wI^4}{384E_cI_e} = \frac{(5)\left(\frac{1000 \text{ plf}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) (12 \text{ in/ft} \times 20 \text{ ft})^4}{(384) (3.122 \times 10^6 \text{ psi}) (4714 \text{ in.}^4)} = \underline{0.245 \text{ in.}^*} \end{split}$$

### **(b) Instantaneous or Short-Term Deflection for Dead <sup>+</sup> Full Live Load (***δD***+***L***)**

$$M_a = \frac{(1.7 \text{ klf})(20 \text{ ft})^2}{8} = 85 \text{ ft-k}$$

Noting that the value of *Ie* changes when the moments change

$$I_e = \left(\frac{27.4 \text{ ft-k}}{85 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3 (8000 \text{ in.}^4) + \left[1 - \left(\frac{27.4 \text{ ft-k}}{85 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3\right] (4067 \text{ in.}^4) = 4199 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$\delta_{D+L} = \frac{(5) \left(\frac{1700 \text{ plf}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) (12 \text{ in/ft} \times 20 \text{ ft})^4}{(384) (3.122 \times 10^6 \text{ psi}) (4199 \text{ in.}^4)} = 0.467 \text{ in.}^*$$

### **(c) Initial Deflection for Full Live Load (***δL***)**

$$\delta_L = \delta_{D+L} - \delta_D = 0.467 \text{ in.} - 0.245 \text{ in.} = \underline{0.222 \text{ in.}^*}$$

This is the live load deflection that would be compared with the first or second row of Table 6.1. If the beam is part of a floor system that is ''not supporting or attached to nonstructural elements likely to be damaged by large deflections'' (left column of Table 6.1),

<sup>\*</sup> The authors really got carried away in this chapter when they calculated deflection to thousandths of an inch. We cannot expect this kind of accuracy, and accuracy to within hundredths of an inch, and perhaps even tenths, is more realistic. These instances are denoted in this chapter by \*'s.

then the deflection limit is  $\ell/480 = (20 \text{ ft})(12 \text{ in/ft})/360 = 0.67 \text{ in}$ . This limit would easily be satisfied in this case, as the calculated deflection is only 0.22 in.

(d) Initial Deflection Due to Dead Load + 30% Live Load  $(\delta_D + \delta_{SI})$ 

$$\begin{split} M_a &= \frac{(1.0 \text{ klf} + 0.30 \times 0.7 \text{ klf}) (20 \text{ ft})^2}{8} = 60.5 \text{ ft-k} \\ I_e &= \left(\frac{27.4 \text{ ft-k}}{60.5 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3 (8000 \text{ in.}^4) + \left[1 - \left(\frac{27.4 \text{ ft-k}}{60.5 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3\right] (4067 \text{ in.}^4) = 4432 \text{ in.}^4 \\ \delta_D + \delta_{SL} &= \frac{(5) \frac{(1000 \text{ plf} + 0.30 \times 700 \text{ plf})}{12} (12 \text{ in/ft} \times 20 \text{ ft})^4}{(384) (3.122 \times 10^6 \text{ psi}) (4432 \text{ in.}^4)} = 0.315 \text{ in.}^* \end{split}$$

(e) Initial Deflection Due to 30% Live Load ( $\delta_{SL}$ )

$$\delta_{SI} = (\delta_D + \delta_{SI}) - \delta_D = 0.315 \text{ in.} - 0.245 \text{ in.} = 0.070 \text{ in.}^*$$

(f) Long-Term Deflection for Dead Load Plus Three Years of 30% Sustained Live Load  $(\delta_{I,\tau})$ 

$$\begin{split} \lambda_{\infty} &= \frac{2.0}{1+50\rho'} = \frac{2.0}{1+0} = 2.0\\ \lambda_{3 \text{ years}} &= \frac{1.80}{1+0} = 1.80\\ \delta_{LT} &= \delta_L + \lambda_{\infty} \delta_D + \lambda_{3 \text{ years}} \delta_{SL}\\ &= 0.222 \text{ in.} + (2.0) (0.245 \text{ in.}) + (1.80) (0.070 \text{ in.}) = 0.838 \text{ in.}^* \end{split}$$

The middle column of Table 6.1 describes this deflection for the last two rows of the table. The answer is compared with either  $\ell/480$  or  $\ell/240$ , depending on whether the structural member supports elements likely to be damaged by large deflections.

#### **Continuous-Beam Deflections**

The following discussion considers a continuous T beam subjected to both positive and negative moments. As shown in Figure 6.6, the effective moment of inertia used for calculating deflections varies a great deal throughout the member. For instance, at the center of the span at Section 1-1 where the positive moment is largest, the web is cracked and the effective section consists of the hatched section plus the tensile reinforcing in the bottom of the web. At Section 2–2 in the figure, where the largest negative moment occurs, the flange is cracked and the effective section consists of the hatched part of the web (including any compression steel in the bottom of the web) plus the tensile bars in the top. Finally, near the points of inflection, the moment will be so low that the beam will probably be uncracked, and thus the whole cross section is effective, as shown for Section 3–3 in the figure. (For this case I is usually calculated only for the web, and the effect of the flanges is neglected, as shown in Figure 6.10.)

From the preceding discussion it is obvious that to calculate the deflection in a continuous beam, theoretically it is necessary to use a deflection procedure that takes into account the varying moment of inertia along the span. Such a procedure would be very lengthy, and it is doubtful that the results so obtained would be within  $\pm 20\%$  of the actual values. For this reason

**FI GU RE 6.6** Deflections for a continuous T beam.

the ACI Code (9.5.2.4) permits the use of a constant moment of inertia throughout the member equal to the average of the *Ie* values computed at the critical positive- and negative-moment sections. *The Ie values at the critical negative-moment sections are averaged with each other, and then that average is averaged with Ie at the critical positive-moment section.* It should also be noted that the multipliers for long-term deflection at these sections should be averaged, as were the *Ie* values.

Example 6.2 illustrates the calculation of deflections for a continuous member. Although much of the repetitious math is omitted from the solution given herein, you can see that the calculations are still very lengthy, and you will understand why approximate deflection calculations are commonly used for continuous spans.

#### Example 6.2

Determine the instantaneous deflection at the midspan of the continuous T beam shown in Figure 6.7(a). The member supports a dead load, including its own weight, of 1.5 k/ft, and a live load of 2.5 k/ft. *f <sup>c</sup>* = 3000 psi and *n* = 9. The moment diagram for full dead and live loads is shown in Figure 6.7(b), and the beam cross section is shown in Figure 6.7(c).

#### SOLUTION

#### For Positive-Moment Region

1. Locating centroidal axis for uncracked section and calculating gross moment of inertia  $I_a$  and cracking moment  $M_{cr}$  for the positive-moment region (Figure 6.8). See Example 2.2 of this text.

$$\overline{y} = \frac{\text{(60 in.) (5 in.)} \left(\frac{5 \text{ in.}}{2}\right) + \text{(27 in.) (12 in.)} \left(5 \text{ in.} + \frac{27 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)}{\text{(60 in.) (5 in.)} + \text{(27 in.) (12 in.)}} = 10.81 \text{ in.}$$

![](_page_186_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 6.8** Centroid of uncracked section in Example 6.2.

$$I_g = \frac{(60 \text{ in.}) (5 \text{ in.})^3}{12} + (60 \text{ in.}) (5 \text{ in.}) \left(10.81 \text{ in.} - \frac{5 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)^2 + \frac{(12 \text{ in.}) (27 \text{ in.})^3}{12}$$

$$+ (12 \text{ in.}) (27 \text{ in.}) \left(21.19 \text{ in.} - \frac{27 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)^2 = 60,185 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$M_{cr} = \frac{(7.5) (\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}) (60,185 \text{ in.}^4)}{21.19 \text{ in.}} = 1,166,754 \text{ in-lb} = 97.2 \text{ ft-k}$$

2. Locating the centroidal axis of cracked section and calculating transformed moment of inertia  $I_{cr}$  for the positive-moment region (Figure 6.9). See Example 2.6 of this text.

$$x = 5.65 \text{ in.}$$
 $I_{cr} = 24,778 \text{ in.}^4$ 

![](_page_186_Figure_7.jpeg)

**FIGURE 6.9** Centroidal axis of cracked section in Example 6.2.

**3.** Calculating the effective moment of inertia in the positive-moment region.

$$M_a = 150 \text{ ft-k}$$

$$I_e = \left(\frac{97.2 \text{ ft-k}}{150 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3 (60,185 \text{ in.}^4) + \left[1 - \left(\frac{97.2 \text{ ft-k}}{150 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3\right] 24,778 \text{ in.}^4 = 34,412 \text{ in.}^4$$

#### **For Negative-Moment Region**

**1.** Locating the centroidal axis for uncracked section and calculating gross moment of inertia *I <sup>g</sup>* and cracking moment *Mcr* for the negative-moment region, considering only the hatched rectangle shown in Figure 6.10.

$$\overline{y} = \left(\frac{32 \text{ in.}}{2}\right) = 16 \text{ in.}$$

$$I_g = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (12 \text{ in.}) (32 \text{ in.})^3 = 32,768 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$M_{cr} = \frac{(7.5) (\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}) (32,768 \text{ in.}^4)}{16 \text{ in.}} = 841,302 \text{ in-lb} = 70.1 \text{ ft-k}$$

The code does not require that the designer ignore the flanges in tension for this calculation. The authors used this method to be conservative. If the tension flanges are considered, then the cracking moment is calculated from the section in Figure 6.8. The value of *y* is taken to the top of the section (10.81 in.) because the top is in tension for negative moment, so

$$M_{cr} = \frac{7.5\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}(60,185 \text{ in.}^4)}{10.81 \text{ in.}} = 2,287,096 \text{ in-lb} = 190.6 \text{ ft-k}$$

If this larger value for *Mcr* were used in step 3 below, the value of *Ie* would be 33,400 in.4.

**2.** Locating the centroidal axis of the cracked section and calculating the transformed moment of inertia *I tr* for the negative-moment region (Figure 6.11). See Example 2.7 for this type of calculation.

$$x = 10.43 \text{ in.}$$
 $I_{cr} = 24,147 \text{ in.}^4$

**FIGURE 6.11** Centroidal axis of cracked section for negative moment in Example 6.2.

3. Calculating the effective moment of inertia in the negative-moment region.

$$M_a = 300 \text{ ft-k}$$

$$I_e = \left(\frac{70.1 \text{ ft-k}}{300 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3 (32,768 \text{ in.}^4) + \left[1 - \left(\frac{70.1 \text{ ft-k}}{300 \text{ ft-k}}\right)^3\right] 24,147 \text{ in.}^4 = 24,257 \text{ in.}^4$$

#### Instantaneous Deflection

The  $I_e$  to be used is obtained by averaging the  $I_e$  at the positive-moment section, with the average of  $I_e$  computed at the negative-moment sections at the ends of the span.

Average 
$$I_{\rm e}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{24{,}257~{\rm in.}^4+24{,}257~{\rm in.}^4}{2}\right)+34{,}412~{\rm in.}^4\right]=29{,}334~{\rm in.}^4$$
 
$$E_{\rm c}=57{,}000\sqrt{3000}~{\rm psi}=3.122\times10^6~{\rm psi}$$

Using the equation from Figure 6.2(b) and using only live loads to calculate deflections,

$$\delta_L = \frac{w_L I^4}{384 \, E_c I_e} = \frac{(2.5 \text{ klf}) (30 \text{ ft})^4}{(384) (3122 \text{ ksi}) (29,334 \text{ in.}^4)} (1728 \text{ in}^3/\text{ft}^3) = 0.10 \text{ in.}$$

In this case the authors used an approximate method to calculate  $\delta_L$ . Instead of the cumbersome equation ( $\delta_L = \delta_{D+L} - \delta_D$ ) we used earlier in Example 6.1(c), we simply used  $w_L$  as the load in the above equation and averaged  $I_e$ . This approximation ignores the difference between  $I_e$  for dead load compared with  $I_e$  for dead and live load. This method gives a larger deflection, so it is conservative. Many designers have conservative approximations that they try first on many engineering calculations. If they work, there is no need to carry out the more cumbersome ones.

It has been shown that for continuous spans, the code (9.5.2.4) suggests an averaging of the  $I_e$  values at the critical positive- and negative-moment sections. The ACI Commentary (R9.5.2.4) says that for approximate deflection calculations for continuous prismatic members, it is satisfactory to use the midspan section properties for simple and continuous spans and at supports for cantilevers. This is because these properties, which include the effect of cracking, have the greatest effect on deflections.

ACI Committee 435 has shown that better results for the deflections in continuous members can be obtained if an *Ie* is used that gives greater weight to the midspan values.7 The committee suggests the use of the following expressions in which *Iem*, *Ie*1, and *Ie*<sup>2</sup> are the computed effective moments of inertia at the midspan and the two ends of the span, respectively.

Beams with two ends continuous

$$Avg I_e = 0.70I_{em} + 0.15(I_{e1} + I_{e2})$$

Beams with one end continuous

Avg 
$$I_e = 0.85I_{em} + 0.15(I_{\text{cont. end}})$$

For the beam of Example 6.2 with its two continuous ends, the effective moment of inertia would be

Avg 
$$I_e = (0.70) (34,412 \text{ in.}^4) + (0.15) (24,257 \text{ in.}^4 + 24,257 \text{ in.}^4)$$
  
= 31,365 in.<sup>4</sup>

### **6.9 Types of Cracks**

This section presents a few introductory comments concerning some of the several types of cracks that occur in reinforced concrete beams. The remainder of this chapter is concerned with the estimated widths of flexural cracks and recommended maximum spacings of flexural bars to control cracks.

*Flexural cracks* are vertical cracks that extend from the tension sides of beams up to the region of their neutral axes. They are illustrated in Figure 6.12(a). Should beams have very deep webs (more than 3 ft or 4 ft), the cracks will be very closely spaced, with some of them coming together above the reinforcing and some disappearing there. These cracks may be wider up in the middle of the beam than at the bottom.

![](_page_189_Picture_12.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 6.12** Some types of cracks in concrete members.

<sup>7</sup> ACI Committee 435, 1978, "Proposed Revisions by Committee 435 to ACI Building Code and Commentary Provisions on Deflections," *Journal ACI*, 75(6), pp. 229–238.

Inclined cracks due to shear can develop in the webs of reinforced concrete beams either as independent cracks or as extensions of flexural cracks. Occasionally, inclined cracks will develop independently in a beam, even though no flexural cracks are in that locality. These cracks, which are called *web-shear cracks* and which are illustrated in Figure 6.12(b), sometimes occur in the webs of prestressed sections, particularly those with large flanges and thin webs.

The usual type of inclined shear cracks are the *flexure-shear cracks*, which are illustrated in Figure 6.12(c). They commonly develop in both prestressed and nonprestressed beams.

*Torsion cracks*, which are illustrated in Figure 6.12(d), are quite similar to shear cracks except that they spiral around the beam. Should a plain concrete member be subjected to pure torsion, it will crack and fail along 45◦ spiral lines due to the diagonal tension corresponding to the torsional stresses. For a very effective demonstration of this type of failure, you can take a piece of chalk in your hands and twist it until it breaks. Although torsion stresses are very similar to shear stresses, they will occur on all faces of a member. As a result, they add to the shear stresses on one side and subtract from them on the other.

Sometimes bond stresses between the concrete and the reinforcing lead to a splitting along the bars, as shown in Figure 6.12(e).

Of course, there are other types of cracks not illustrated here. Members that are loaded in axial tension will have transverse cracks through their entire cross sections. Cracks can also occur in concrete members due to shrinkage, temperature change, settlements, and so on. Considerable information concerning the development of cracks is available.8

### **6.10 Control of Flexural Cracks**

Cracks are going to occur in reinforced concrete structures because of concrete's low tensile strength. For members with low steel stresses at service loads, the cracks may be very small and in fact may not be visible except upon careful examination. Such cracks, called *microcracks*, are generally initiated by bending stresses.

When steel stresses are high at service load, particularly where high-strength steels are used, visible cracks will occur. These cracks should be limited to certain maximum sizes so that the appearance of the structure is not spoiled and so that corrosion of the reinforcing does not result. The use of high-strength bars and the strength method of design have made crack control a very important item indeed. Because the yield stresses of reinforcing bars in general use have increased from 40 ksi to 60 ksi and above, it has been rather natural for designers to specify approximately the same size bars as they are accustomed to using, but fewer of them. The result has been more severe cracking of members.

Although cracks cannot be eliminated, they can be limited to acceptable sizes by spreading out or distributing the reinforcement. In other words, smaller cracks will result if several small bars are used with moderate spacings rather than a few large ones with large spacings. Such a practice will usually result in satisfactory crack control even for Grades 60 and 75 bars. An excellent rule of thumb to use as regards cracking is "*don*'*t use a bar spacing larger than about 9 in*."

The maximum crack widths that are considered to be acceptable vary from approximately 0.004 in. to 0.016 in., depending on the location of the member in question, the type of structure, the surface texture of the concrete, illumination, and other factors. Somewhat smaller values may be required for members exposed to very aggressive environments, such as deicing chemicals and saltwater spray.

TABLE 6.3 Permissible Crack Widths

ACI Committee 224, in a report on cracking, 9 presented a set of approximately permissible maximum crack widths for reinforced concrete members subject to different exposure situations. These values are summarized in Table 6.3.

Definite data are not available as to the sizes of cracks above which bar corrosion becomes particularly serious. As a matter of fact, tests seem to indicate that concrete quality, cover thickness, amount of concrete vibration, and other variables may be more important than crack sizes in their effect on corrosion.

Results of laboratory tests of reinforced concrete beams to determine crack sizes vary. The sizes are greatly affected by shrinkage and other time-dependent factors. The purpose of crack-control calculations is not really to limit cracks to certain rigid maximum values but rather to use reasonable bar details, as determined by field and laboratory experience, that will in effect keep cracks within a reasonable range.

The following equation was developed for the purpose of estimating the maximum widths of cracks that will occur in the tension faces of flexural members. 10 It is merely a simplification of the many variables affecting crack sizes.

$$w = 0.076 \beta_h f_s \sqrt[3]{d_c A}$$

where

w = the estimated cracking width in thousandths of inches

 $\beta_h$  = ratio of the distance to the neutral axis from the extreme tension concrete fiber to the distance from the neutral axis to the centroid of the tensile steel (values to be determined by the working-stress method)

 $f_s$  = steel stress, in kips per square inch at service loads (designer is permitted to use  $0.6 f_{v}$  for normal structures)

 $d_c$  = the cover of the outermost bar measured from the extreme tension fiber to the center of the closest bar or wire (for bundled bars,  $d_c$  is measured to the centroid of the bundles)

A = the effective tension area of concrete around the main reinforcing (having the same centroid as the reinforcing) divided by the number of bars

This expression is referred to as the Gergely-Lutz equation after its developers. In applying it to beams, reasonable results are usually obtained if  $\beta_h$  is set equal to 1.20. For thin one-way slabs, however, more realistic values are obtained if  $\beta_h$  is set equal to 1.35.

The number of reinforcing bars present in a particular member decidedly affects the value of A to be used in the equation and thus the calculated crack width. If more and smaller bars

are used to provide the necessary area, the value of *A* will be smaller, as will the estimated crack widths.

Should all the bars in a particular group not be the same size, their number (for use in the equation) should be considered to equal the total reinforcing steel area actually provided in the group divided by the area of the largest bar size used.

Example 6.3 illustrates the determination of the estimated crack widths occurring in a tensilely reinforced rectangular beam.

### Example 6.3

Assuming β*<sup>h</sup>* = 1.20 and *fy* = 60 ksi, calculate the estimated width of flexural cracks that will occur in the beam of Figure 6.13. If the beam is to be exposed to moist air, is this width satisfactory as compared to the values given in Table 6.3 of this chapter? Should the cracks be too wide, revise the design of the reinforcing and recompute the crack width.

#### **SOLUTION**

#### **Substituting into the Gergely–Lutz Equation**

$$d_c = 3 \text{ in.}$$

$$A = \frac{(6 \text{ in.}) (16 \text{ in.})}{3} = 32 \text{ in.}^2$$

$$w = (0.076) (1.20) (0.6 \times 60 \text{ ksi}) \sqrt[3]{(3 \text{ in.}) (32 \text{ in.}^2)}$$

$$= \frac{15.03 \text{ in.}}{1000} = 0.015 \text{ in.} > 0.012 \text{ in.} \qquad \underline{\text{No good}}$$

![](_page_193_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 6.13** Beam properties for Example 6.3.

Replace the three #11 bars (4.68 in.2) with five #9 bars (5.00 in.2).

$$A = \frac{\text{(6 in.) (16 in.)}}{5} = 19.2 \text{ in.}^2$$

$$w = (0.076) (1.20) (0.6 \times 60 \text{ ksi}) \sqrt[3]{\text{(3 in.) (19.2 in.}^2)}$$

$$= \frac{12.68 \text{ in.}}{1000} = 0.0127 \text{ in.} > 0.012 \text{ in.} \quad \underline{\text{No good}}$$

Try six #8 bars (4.71 in.2).

$$A = \frac{(6 \text{ in.}) (16 \text{ in.})}{6} = 16 \text{ in.}^{2}$$

$$w = (0.076) (1.20) (0.6 \times 60 \text{ ksi}) \sqrt[3]{(3 \text{ in.}) (16 \text{ in.}^{2})}$$

$$= \frac{11.93 \text{ in.}}{1000} = 0.0119 \text{ in.} < 0.012 \text{ in.} \quad \underline{OK}$$

Use 6 #8 bars.

If reinforced concrete members are tested under carefully controlled laboratory conditions and cracks measured for certain loadings, considerable variations in crack sizes will occur. Consequently, the calculations of crack widths described in this chapter should only be used to help the designer select good details for reinforcing bars. The calculations are clearly not sufficiently accurate for comparison with field crack sizes.

The bond stress between the concrete and the reinforcing steel decidedly affects the sizes and spacings of the cracks in concrete. When bundled bars are used, there is appreciably less contact between the concrete and the steel, as compared to the cases where the bars are placed separately from each other. To estimate crack widths successfully with the Gergely–Lutz equation when bundled bars are used, it is necessary to take into account this reduced contact surface.11

<sup>11</sup> Nawy, E. G., 2009, *Reinforced Concrete: A Fundamental Approach*, 6th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall), pp. 307–309.

When bundled bars are present, some designers use a very conservative procedure in computing the value of A. For this calculation they assume each bundle is one bar, that bar having an area equal to the total area of the bars in that bundle. Certainly, the bond properties of a group of bundled bars are better than those of a single large "equivalent bar."

Particular attention needs to be given to crack control for doubly reinforced beams, where it is common to use small numbers of large-diameter tensile bars. Calculation of crack widths for such beams may result in rather large values, thus in effect requiring the use of a larger number of rather closely spaced smaller bars.

Special rules are given in ACI Section 10.6.6 for the spacings of reinforcing to help control the amount of cracking in T beams whose flanges are in tension.

### 6.11 ACI Code Provisions Concerning Cracks

In the ACI Code, Sections 10.6.3 and 10.6.4 require that flexural tensile reinforcement be well distributed within the zones of maximum tension so that the center-to-center spacing of the reinforcing closest to a tension surface is not greater than the value computed with the following expression:

$$s = (15) \left( \frac{40,000}{f_s} \right) - 2.5c_c \le (12) \left( \frac{40,000}{f_s} \right)$$
 (ACI Equation 10-4)

In this expression,  $f_s$  is the computed tensile stress at working load. It may be calculated by dividing the unfactored bending moment by the beam's internal moment arm (see Example 2.3), or it may simply be taken equal to  $\frac{2}{3}f_y$ . The term  $c_c$  represents the clear cover from the nearest surface in tension to the surface of the tensile reinforcement in inches.

For beams with Grade 60 reinforcing and with 2-in. clear cover, the maximum codepermitted bar spacing is

$$s = (15) \left( \frac{40,000}{0.667 \times 60,000 \text{ psi}} \right) - (2.5) (2 \text{ in.})$$
$$= 10.0 \text{ in.} < (12) \left( \frac{40,000}{0.667 \times 60,000 \text{ psi}} \right) = 12.0 \text{ in.}$$

A bar spacing not more than 10.0 in. would thus be required. This limit can control the spacing of bars in one-way slabs but is not likely to control beam bar spacings.

The authors feel that these ACI maximum bar-spacing provisions are quite reasonable for one-way slabs and for beams with wide webs. For beams with normal web widths used in ordinary buildings, we also feel that estimating crack widths with the Gergely–Lutz equation and comparing the results to the values given in Table 6.3 of this chapter may be a more reasonable procedure. 12

The ACI equation for maximum spacing does not apply to beams with extreme exposure or to structures that are supposed to be watertight. Special consideration must be given to such situations. It is probably well to use the Gergely–Lutz equation and a set of maximum crack widths, such as those of Table 6.3, for such situations.

The effect of cracks and their widths on the corrosion of reinforcing is not clearly understood. There does not seem to be a direct relationship between crack widths and corrosion, at least at the reinforcing stresses occurring when members are subjected to service loads. Thus the ACI Code no longer distinguishes between interior and exterior exposure, as it once did. Research seems to indicate that the total corrosion occurring in reinforcing is not clearly correlated to crack widths. It is true, however, that the time required for corrosion to begin in reinforcing is inversely related to the widths of cracks.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>12</sup> Ibid., p. 303.

When using the Gergely-Lutz crack width expression with SI units, the equation is  $w = 0.0113 \beta_h f_s \sqrt[3]{d_c A}$ , with the resulting crack widths in mm.

The SI version of the ACI Code for the maximum spacing of tensile bars from the standpoint of crack widths is given here. To use this expression correctly, s and  $c_c$  must be used in mm, while  $f_s$  must be in MPa.

$$s = (380) \left(\frac{280}{f_s}\right) - 2.5c_c \le (300) \left(\frac{280}{f_s}\right)$$

#### **Miscellaneous Cracks** 6.12

The beginning designer will learn that it is wise to include a few reinforcing bars in certain places in some structures, even though there seems to be no theoretical need for them. Certain spots in some structures (such as in abutments, retaining walls, building walls near openings, etc.) will develop cracks. The young designer should try to learn about such situations from more experienced people. Better structures will be the result.

#### 6.13 SI Example

#### Example 6.4

Is the spacing of the bars shown in Figure 6.14 within the requirements of the ACI Code from the standpoint of cracking, if  $f_v = 420$  MPa?

#### SOLUTION

For 
$$f_y=420$$
 MPa and  $c_c=75$  mm  $-\frac{28.7 \text{ mm}}{2}=60.65$  mm 
$$s=(380)\left(\frac{280}{0.667\times420\text{ MPa}}\right)-(2.5)(60.65\text{ mm})$$
 
$$=228\text{ mm}<(300)\left(\frac{280}{0.667\times420\text{ MPa}}\right)$$
 
$$=300\text{ mm}$$

Since the actual bar spacing of 75 mm is less than 228 mm, this spacing is acceptable.
