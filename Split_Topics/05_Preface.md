# Preface

### **Audience**

This textbook presents an introduction to reinforced concrete design. We authors hope the material is written in such a manner as to interest students in the subject and to encourage them to continue its study in the years to come. The text was prepared with an introductory three-credit course in mind, but sufficient material is included for an additional three-credit course.

### **New to This Edition**

### **Updated Code**

With the ninth edition of this text, the contents have been updated to conform to the *2011 Building Code of the American Concrete Institute* (ACI 318-11). Changes to this edition of the code include:

- Factored load combinations are now based on ASCE/SEI 7-10, which now treats wind as a strength level load.
- Minor revisions to development length to headed bars.
- Addition of minimum reinforcement provisions to deep beams.
- Introduction of Grade 80 deformed bars in accordance with ASTM 615 and ASTM 706.
- Zinc and epoxy dual-coated reinforcing bars are now permitted in accordance with ASTM A1055.

### **New Chapter on Concrete Masonry**

A new chapter on strength design of reinforced concrete masonry has been added to replace the previous Chapter 20 on formwork. Surveys revealed that the forms chapter was not being used and that a chapter on masonry would be more valuable. Because strength design of reinforced concrete masonry is so similar to that of reinforced concrete, the authors felt that this would be a logical extension to the application of the theories developed earlier in the text. The design of masonry lintels, walls loaded out-of-plane, and shear walls are included. The subject of this chapter could easily occupy an entire textbook, so this chapter is limited in scope to only the basics. An example of the design of each type of masonry element is also included to show the student some typical applications.

### **Units Added to Example Problems**

The example problems now have units associated with the input values. This will assist the student in determining the source of each input value as well as help in the use of dimensional analysis in determining the correct answers and the units of the answers. Often the student can catch errors in calculations simply by checking the dimensions of the calculated answer against what the units are known to be.

### **Organization**

The text is written in the order that the authors feel would follow the normal sequence of presentation for an introductory course in reinforced concrete design. In this way, it is hoped that skipping back and forth from chapter to chapter will be minimized. The material on columns is included in three chapters (Chapters 9, 10, and 11). Some instructors do not have time to cover the material on slender columns, so it was put in a separate chapter (Chapter 11). The remaining material on columns was separated into two chapters in order to emphasize the difference between columns that are primarily axially loaded (Chapter 9) and those with significant bending moment combined with axial load (Chapter 10). The material formerly in Chapter 21, "Seismic Design of Concrete Structures," has been updated and moved to a new appendix (Appendix D).

### **Instructor and Student Resources**

The website for the book is located at [www.wiley.com/college/mccormac an](http://www.wiley.com/college/mccormac)d contains the following resources.

### **For Instructors**

*Solutions Manual* A password-protected Solutions Manual, which contains complete solutions for all homework problems in the text, is available for download. Most are handwritten, but some are carried out using spreadsheets or Mathcad.

*Figures in PPT Format* Also available are the figures from the text in PowerPoint format, for easy creation of lecture slides.

*Lecture Presentation Slides in PPT Format* Presentation slides developed by Dr. Terry Weigel of the University of Louisville are available for instructors who prefer to use PowerPoint for their lectures. The PowerPoint files are posted rather than files in PDF format to permit the instructor to modify them as appropriate for his or her class.

*Sample Exams* Examples of sample exams are included for most topics in the text. Problems in the back of each chapter are also suitable for exam questions.

*Course Syllabus* A course syllabus along with a typical daily schedule are included in editable format.

These resources are available for instructors who have adopted the book for their course. The website may be updated periodically with additional material.

### **For Students and Instructors**

*Excel Spreadsheets* Excel spreadsheets were created to provide the student and the instructor with tools to analyze and design reinforced concrete elements quickly to compare alternative solutions. Spreadsheets are provided for most chapters of the text, and their use is selfexplanatory. Many of the cells contain comments to assist the new user. The spreadsheets can be modified by the student or instructor to suit their more specific needs. In most cases, calculations contained within the spreadsheets mirror those shown in the example problems in the text. The many uses of these spreadsheets are illustrated throughout the text. At the end of most chapters are example problems demonstrating the use of the spreadsheet for that particular chapter. Space does not permit examples for all of the spreadsheet capabilities. The examples chosen were thought by the authors to be the most relevant.
