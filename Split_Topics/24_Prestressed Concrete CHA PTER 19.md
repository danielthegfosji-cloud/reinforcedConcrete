# Prestressed Concrete **CHA PTER 19**

### **19.1 Introduction**

Prestressing can be defined as the imposition of internal stresses into a structure that are of opposite character to those that will be caused by the service or working loads. A common method used to describe prestressing is shown in Figure 19.1, where a row of books has been squeezed together by a person's hands. The resulting "beam" can carry a downward load as long as the compressive stress from squeezing at the bottom of the "beam" is greater than the tensile stress there from the moment produced by the weight of the books and the superimposed loads. Such a beam has no tensile strength and, thus, no moment resistance until it is squeezed together or prestressed. You might very logically now expand your thoughts to a beam consisting of a row of concrete blocks squeezed together and then to a plain concrete beam with its negligible tensile strength similarly prestressed.

The theory of prestressing is quite simple and has been used for many years in various kinds of structures. For instance, wooden barrels have long been made by putting tightened metal bands around them, thus compressing the staves together and making a tight container with resistance to the outward pressures of the enclosed liquids. For concrete beams, prestressing is primarily used to counteract tension stresses caused by the weight of the members and the superimposed loads. Should these loads cause a positive moment in a beam, it is possible by prestressing to introduce a negative moment that can counteract part or all of the positive moment. An ordinary beam has to have sufficient strength to support itself as well as the other loads, but it is possible with prestressing to produce a negative loading that will eliminate the effect of the beam's weight, thus producing a "weightless beam."

From the preceding discussion, it is easy to see why prestressing has captured the imagination of so many persons and why it has all sorts of possibilities now and in the future.

In the earlier chapters of this book, only a portion of the concrete cross sections of members in bending could be considered effective in resisting loads because a large part of those cross sections were in tension, and thus the concrete cracked. If, however, concrete flexural members can be prestressed so that their entire cross sections are kept in compression, then the properties of the entire sections are available to resist the applied forces.

For a more detailed illustration of prestressing, see Figure 19.2. It is assumed that the following steps have been taken with regard to this beam:

- **1.** Steel strands (represented by the dashed lines) were placed in the lower part of the beam form.
- **2.** The strands were tensioned to a very high stress.
- **3.** The concrete was placed in the form and allowed to gain sufficient strength for the prestressed strands to be cut.
- **4.** The strands were cut.

The cut strands tend to resume their original length, thus compressing the lower part of the beam and causing a negative bending moment. The positive moment caused by the beam weight and any superimposed gravity loads is directly opposed by the negative moment. Another way of explaining this is to say that a compression stress has been produced in the bottom of the beam opposite in character to the tensile stress that is caused there by the working loads.

### **19.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of Prestressed Concrete**

### **Advantages**

As described in Section 19.1, it is possible with prestressing to utilize the entire cross sections of members to resist loads. Thus, smaller members can be used to support the same loads, or the same-size members can be used for longer spans. This is a particularly important advantage because member weights make up a substantial part of the total design loads of concrete structures.

Prestressed members are crack-free under working loads and, as a result, look better and are more watertight, providing better corrosion protection for the steel. Furthermore, crackfree prestressed members require less maintenance and last longer than cracked reinforced concrete members. Therefore, for a large number of structures, prestressed concrete provides the lowest first-cost solution, and when its reduced maintenance is considered, prestressed concrete provides the lowest overall cost for many additional cases.

The negative moments caused by prestressing produce camber in the members, with the result that total deflections are reduced. Other advantages of prestressed concrete include the following: reduction in diagonal tension stresses, sections with greater stiffnesses under working loads, and increased fatigue and impact resistance compared to ordinary reinforced concrete.

### **Disadvantages**

Prestressed concrete requires the use of higher-strength concretes and steels and the use of more complicated formwork, with resulting higher labor costs. Other disadvantages include the following:

- **1.** Closer quality control required in manufacture.
- **2.** Losses in the initial prestressing forces. When the compressive forces from prestressing are applied to the concrete, it will shorten somewhat, partially relaxing the cables. The result is some reduction in cable tension with a resulting loss in prestressing forces. Shrinkage and creep of the concrete add to this effect.
- **3.** Additional stress conditions must be checked in design, such as the stresses occurring when prestress forces are first applied and then after prestress losses have taken place, as well as the stresses occurring for different loading conditions.
- **4.** Cost of end anchorage devices and end-beam plates that may be required.

### **19.3 Pretensioning and Posttensioning**

The two general methods of prestressing are pretensioning and posttensioning. *Pretensioning* was illustrated in Section 19.1, where the prestress tendons were tensioned before the concrete was placed. After the concrete had hardened sufficiently, the tendons were cut and the prestress force was transmitted to the concrete by bond. This method is particularly well suited for mass

production because the casting beds can be constructed several hundred feet long. The tendons can be run for the entire bed lengths and used for casting several beams in a line at the same time, as shown in Figure 19.3.

In *posttensioned* construction (see Figure 19.4), the tendons are stressed after the concrete is placed and has gained the desired strength. Plastic or metal tubes, conduits, sleeves, or similar devices with unstressed tendons inside (or later inserted) are located in the form and the concrete is placed. After the concrete has sufficiently hardened, the tendons are stretched and mechanically attached to end anchorage devices to keep the tendons in their stretched positions. Thus, by posttensioning, the prestress forces are transferred to the concrete not by bond but by end bearing.

It is actually possible in posttensioning to have either bonded or unbonded tendons. If bonded, the conduits are often made of aluminum, steel, or other metal sheathing. In addition, it is possible to use steel tubing or rods or rubber cores that are cast in the concrete and removed a few hours after the concrete is placed. After the steel is tensioned, cement grout is injected into the duct for bonding. The grout is also useful in protecting the steel from corrosion. If the tendons are to be unbonded, they should be greased to facilitate tensioning and to protect them from corrosion.1

### **19.4 Materials Used for Prestressed Concrete**

The materials ordinarily used for prestressed concrete are concrete and high-strength steels. The concrete used is normally of a higher strength than that used for reinforced concrete members, for several reasons, including the following:

- **1.** The modulus of elasticity of such concretes is higher, with the result that the elastic strains in the concrete are smaller when the tendons are cut. Thus, the relaxations or losses in the tendon stresses are smaller.
- **2.** In prestressed concrete, the entire members are kept in compression, and thus all the concrete is effective in resisting forces. Hence, it is reasonable to pay for a more expensive but stronger concrete if all of it is going to be used. (In ordinary reinforced concrete beams, more than half of the cross sections are in tension and, thus, assumed to be cracked. As a result, more than half of a higher-strength concrete used there would be wasted.)

- **3.** Most prestressed work in the United States is of the precast, pretensioned type done at the prestress yard, where the work can be carefully controlled. Consequently, dependable higher-strength concrete can readily be obtained.
- **4.** For pretensioned work, the higher-strength concretes permit the use of higher bond stresses between the cables and the concrete.

High-strength steels are necessary to produce and keep satisfactory prestress forces in members. The strains that occur in these steels during stressing are much greater than those that can be obtained with ordinary reinforcing steels. As a result, when the concrete elastically shortens in compression and also shortens because of creep and shrinkage, the losses in strain in the steel (and thus stress) represent a smaller percentage of the total stress. Another reason for using high-strength steels is that a large prestress force can be developed in a small area.

Early work with prestressed concrete using ordinary-strength bars to induce the prestressing forces in the concrete resulted in failure because the low stresses that could be put into the bars were completely lost due to the concrete's shrinkage and creep. Should a prestress of 20,000 psi be put into such rods, the resulting strains would be equal to  $20,000/(29 \times 10^6) = 0.00069$ . This value is less than the long-term creep and shrinkage strain normally occurring in concrete, roughly 0.0008, which would completely relieve the stress in the steel. Should a high-strength steel be stressed to about 150,000 psi and have the same creep and shrinkage, the stress reduction will be of the order of  $(0.0008)(29 \times 10^6) = 23,000$  psi, leaving 150,000 - 23,200 = 126,800 psi in the steel (a loss of only 15.47% of the steel stress).<sup>2</sup>

Three forms of prestressing steel are used: single wires, wire strands, and bars. The greater the diameter of the wires, the smaller become their strengths and bond to the concrete. As a result, wires are manufactured with diameters from 0.192 in. up to a maximum of 0.276 in. (about  $\frac{9}{32}$  in.). In posttensioning work, large numbers of wires are grouped in parallel into tendons. Strands that are made by twisting wires together are used for most pretensioned work. They are of the seven-wire type, where a center wire is tightly surrounded by twisting the other six wires helically around it. Strands are manufactured with diameters from  $\frac{1}{4}$  in. to  $\frac{1}{2}$  in. Sometimes large, high-strength, heat-treated alloy steel bars are used for posttensioned sections. They are available with diameters running from  $\frac{3}{4}$  in. to  $1\frac{3}{8}$  in.

High-strength prestressing steels do not have distinct yield points (see Figure 19.10) as do the structural carbon reinforcing steels. The practice of considering yield points, however,

is so firmly embedded in the average designer's mind that high-strength steels are normally given an arbitrary yield point anyway. The yield stress for wires and strands is usually assumed to be the stress that causes a total elongation of 1% to occur in the steel. For high-strength bars, the yield stress is assumed to occur when a 0.2% permanent strain occurs.

### **19.5 Stress Calculations**

For a consideration of stresses in a prestressed rectangular beam, refer to Figure 19.5. For this example, the prestress tendons are assumed to be straight, although it will later be shown that a curved shape is more practical for most beams. The tendons are assumed to be located an eccentric distance, *e*, below the centroidal axis of the beam. As a result, the beam is subjected to a combination of direct compression and a moment because of the eccentricity of the prestress. In addition, there will be a moment from the external load, including the beam's own weight. The resulting stress at any point in the beam caused by these three factors can be written as follows, where *P* is the prestressing force:

$$f = -\frac{P}{A} \pm \frac{Pec}{I} \pm \frac{Mc}{I}$$

In this expression, *P* is the prestress force, *e* is the eccentricity of the prestress force with respect to the centroid of the cross section, *c* is the distance from the centroidal axis to the extreme fiber (top or bottom depending on where the stresses are being determined), *M* is the applied moment from unfactored loads at the stage at which stresses are being calculated, *A* is the uncracked concrete cross-sectional area, and *I* is the moment of inertia of the gross concrete cross section. In Figure 19.5, a stress diagram is drawn for each of these three items, and all three are combined to give the final stress diagram.

The usual practice is to base the stress calculations in the elastic range on the properties of the gross concrete section. The gross section consists of the concrete external dimensions with no additions made for the transformed area of the steel tendons or subtractions made for the duct areas in posttensioning. This method is considered to give satisfactory results

because the changes in stresses obtained if net or transformed properties are used are usually not significant.

Example 19.1 illustrates the calculations needed to determine the stresses at various points in a simple-span prestressed rectangular beam. It will be noted that, as there are no moments at the ends of a simple beam from the external loads or to the beam's own weight, the *Mc*/*I* part of the stress equation is zero there and the equation reduces to

$$f = -\frac{P}{A} \pm \frac{Pec}{I}$$

m ksi} - 1.953~{
m ksi} = -2.821~{

In Example 19.1, it was shown that when the prestress tendons are straight, the tensile stress at the top of the beam at the ends will be quite high. If, however, the tendons are draped, as shown in Figure 19.7, it is possible to reduce or even eliminate the tensile stresses. Out in the span, the centroid of the strands may be below the lower kern point (see Example 19.2 for determination of the kern point for this section), but if at the ends of the beam, where there is no stress due to dead-load moment, it is below the kern point, tensile stresses in the top will be the result. If the tendons are draped so that at the ends they are located at or above this point, tension will not occur in the top of the beam.

![](_page_593_Figure_9.jpeg)

FIGURE 19.7 Draped tendons.

In posttensioning, the sleeve or conduit is placed in the forms in the curved position desired. The tendons in pretensioned members can be placed at or above the lower kern points and then can be pushed down to the desired depth at the centerline or at other points. In Figure 19.7, the tendons are shown held down at the one-third points. Two alternatives to draped tendons that have been used are to use straight tendons, located below the lower kern point but that are encased in tubes at their ends or that have their ends greased. Both methods are used to prevent the development of negative moments at the beam ends.

In ACI Section 18.3.3, bonded and unbonded prestressed members are designated as being Class U, T, or C members. These classifications are based on computed tensile stresses in members subject to service loads. Class U members are those that are assumed to be uncracked and have maximum tensile stresses  $f_t \leq 7.5\sqrt{f_c'}$ . Class C members are those that are assumed to be cracked and have  $f_t > 12\sqrt{f_c'}$ . Class T members are assumed to be in transition between cracked and uncracked members and have maximum tensile stresses  $> 7.5\sqrt{f_c'} \leq 12\sqrt{f_c'}$ . Prestressed two-way slabs must be designed as Class U sections with  $f_t \leq 6\sqrt{f_c'}$ .

ACI Section 18.3.4 states that for Class U and T members, flexural stresses may be computed using the uncracked section properties. For Class C sections, however, it is necessary to use cracked section properties.

Example 19.2 shows the calculations necessary to locate the kern point for the beam of Example 19.1. In addition, the stresses at the top and bottom of the beam ends are computed. It will be noted that, according to these calculations, the kern point is 4 in. below the middepth of the beam, and it would thus appear that the prestress tendons should be located at the kern point at the beam ends and pushed down to the desired depth farther out in the beam. Actually, however, the tendons at the beam ends do not have to be as high as the kern points because the ACI Code (18.4.1) permits some tension in the top of the beam when the tendons are cut. This value is  $3\sqrt{f'_{ci}}$ , where  $f'_{ci}$  is the strength of the concrete at the time the tendons are cut, as determined by testing concrete cylinders. The subscript i denotes "initial," meaning at initial release of the prestressing tendon, before the concrete gains its full 28-day strength. This permissible value equals about 40% of the cracking strength or modulus of rupture of the concrete  $\left(7.5\sqrt{f'_{ci}}\right)$  at that time. The stress at the bottom of the beam, which is compressive, is permitted to go as high as  $0.60f'_{ci}$ .

The code actually permits tensile stresses at the ends of simple beams to go as high as  $6\sqrt{f_{ci}^{\prime}}$ . These allowable tensile values are applicable to the stresses that occur immediately after the transfer of the prestressing forces and after the losses occur from elastic shortening of the concrete and relaxation of the tendons and anchorage seats. It is further assumed that the time-dependent losses of creep and shrinkage have not occurred. A discussion of these various losses is presented in Section 19.7 of this chapter. If the calculated tensile stresses are greater than the permissible values, it is necessary to use some additional bonded reinforcing (prestressed or unprestressed) to resist the *total* tensile force in the concrete computed on the basis of an uncracked section.

Section 18.4.2 of the code provides allowable stresses at service loads for Class U and Class T members after all prestress losses have occurred. An extreme fiber compression stress equal to  $0.60f_c'$  is permitted for prestress plus sustained loads. The allowable compression stress for prestress plus total loads is  $0.70f_c'$ . In effect, the ACI here provides a one-third increase in allowable compression stress when a large percentage of the service loads are deemed to be transient or of short duration.

The allowable tensile stress at ends of simply supported members immediately after prestress transfer is  $6\sqrt{f_{ci}'}$ . Section 18.4.3 of the code allows higher permissible stresses than those here under certain conditions. The commentary on this section of the code states that it is the intent of the code's writers to permit higher stress values when justified by the development of newer and better products, materials, and prestress techniques. Approval of such increases must be in accordance with the procedures of Section 1.4 of the code.

Only compressive stresses should be allowed in prestressed sections that are to be used in severe corrosive conditions. If tension cracks occur, the result may very well be increased cable corrosion.

#### Example 19.2

Determine the location of the lower kern point at the ends of the beam of Example 19.1. Calculate the stresses at the top and bottom of the beam ends, assuming the tendons are placed at the kern point.

#### SOLUTION

#### Locating the Kern Point

$$f_{\text{top}} = -\frac{P}{A} + \frac{Pec}{I} = 0$$

$$-\frac{250 \text{ k}}{288 \text{ in.}^2} + \frac{(250 \text{ k}) (e) (12 \text{ in.})}{13,824 \text{ in.}^4} = 0$$

$$-0.868 \text{ ksi} + 0.217e = 0$$

$$e = 4 \text{ in.}$$

#### **Computing Stresses**

$$\begin{split} f_{\text{top}} &= -\frac{P}{A} - \frac{Pec}{I} = -\frac{250 \text{ k}}{288 \text{ in.}^2} + \frac{(250 \text{ k}) \text{ (4 in.) (12 in.)}}{13,824 \text{ in.}^4} \\ &= -0.868 \text{ ksi} + 0.868 \text{ ksi} = 0 \\ f_{\text{bottom}} &= -\frac{P}{A} - \frac{Pec}{I} = -0.868 \text{ ksi} - 0.868 \text{ ksi} = -1.736 \text{ ksi} \end{split}$$

### **Shapes of Prestressed Sections**

For simplicity in introducing prestressing theory, rectangular sections are used for most of the examples of this chapter. From the viewpoint of formwork alone, rectangular sections are the most economical, but more complicated shapes, such as I's and T's, will require smaller quantities of concrete and prestressing steel to carry the same loads and, as a result, they frequently have the lowest overall costs.

If a member is to be made only one time, a cross section requiring simple formwork (thus, often rectangular) will probably be used. For instance, simple formwork is essential for most cast-in-place work. Should, however, the forms be used a large number of times to make many identical members, more complicated cross sections, such as I's and T's, channels, or boxes, will be used. For such sections, the cost of the formwork as a percentage of each member's total cost will be greatly reduced. Several types of commonly used prestressed sections are shown in Figure 19.8. The same general theory used for the determination of stresses and flexural strengths applies to shapes such as these, as it does to rectangular sections.

The usefulness of a particular section depends on the simplicity and reusability of the formwork, the appearance of the sections, the degree of difficulty of placing the concrete, and the theoretical properties of the cross section. The greater the amount of concrete located near the extreme fibers of a beam, the greater will be the lever arm between the C and T forces and, thus, the greater the resisting moment. Of course, there are some limitations on the widths

and thicknesses of the flanges. In addition, the webs must be sufficiently large to resist shear and to allow the proper placement of the concrete and at the same time be sufficiently thick to avoid buckling.

A prestressed single T, such as the one shown in Figure 19.8(a), is often a very economical section because a large proportion of the concrete is placed in the compression flange, where it is quite effective in resisting compressive forces. The double T shown in Figure 19.8(b) is used for schools, office buildings, stores, and so on and is probably the most used prestressed section in the United States today. The total width of the flange provided by a double T is in the range of about 5 ft to 8 ft, and spans of 30 ft to 50 ft are common. You can see that a floor or roof system can be erected easily and quickly by placing a series of precast double T's side by side  $\top \top \top \top$ TT. The sections serve as both the beams and slabs for the floor or roof system. Single T's are normally used for heavier loads and longer spans up to as high as 100 ft or 120 ft. Double T's for such spans would be very heavy and difficult to handle. The single T is not used as much today as it was in the recent past because of stability difficulties in both shipping and erection.

The I and box sections, shown in parts (c) and (d) of Figure 19.8, have a larger proportion of their concrete placed in their flanges, with the result that larger moments of inertia are possible (as compared to rectangular sections with the same amounts of concrete and prestressing tendons). The formwork, however, is complicated, and the placing of concrete is difficult. Box girders are frequently used for bridge spans. Unsymmetrical I's [Figure 19.8(e)], with large bottom flanges to contain the tendons and small top flanges, may be economical for certain composite sections where they are used together with a slab poured in place to provide the compression flange. A similar situation is shown in Figure 19.8(f), where an inverted T is used with a cast-in-place slab.

Many variations of these sections are used, such as the channel section shown in Figure 19.8(g). Such a section might be made by blocking out the flanges of a double-T form as shown, and the resulting members might be used for stadium seats or similar applications.

#### **Prestress Losses** 19.7

The flexural stresses calculated for the beams of Examples 19.1 and 19.2 were based on initial stresses in the prestress tendons. These stresses, however, become smaller with time (over a period of roughly five years) because of several factors. These factors, which are discussed in the paragraphs to follow, include:

- 1. Elastic shortening of the concrete
- 2. Shrinkage and creep of the concrete
- 3. Relaxation or creep in the tendons
- 4. Slippage in posttensioning end anchorage systems
- 5. Friction along the ducts used in posttensioning

Although it is possible to calculate prestress losses individually for each of the factors listed, it is usually more practical and often just as satisfactory to use single lump-sum estimates for all the items together. There are just too many interrelated factors affecting the estimates to achieve accuracy.

Such lump-sum estimates of total prestress losses are applicable only to average prestressed members made with normal concrete, construction procedures, and quality control. Should conditions be decidedly different from these and/or if the project is extremely significant, it would be well to consider making detailed loss estimates such as those introduced in the next few paragraphs.

The ultimate strength of a prestressed member is almost completely controlled by the tensile strength and cross-sectional area of the cables. Consequently, losses in prestress will have very little effect on its ultimate flexural strength. However, losses in prestress will cause more cracking to occur under working loads, with the result that deflections will be larger. Furthermore, the member's shear and fatigue strength will be somewhat reduced.

### **Elastic Shortening of the Concrete**

When the tendons are cut for a pretensioned member, the prestress force is transferred to the concrete, with the result that the concrete is put in compression and shortens, thus permitting some relaxation or shortening of the tendons. The stress in the concrete adjacent to the tendons can be computed as described in the preceding examples. The strain in the concrete, *<sup>c</sup>* , which equals *fc*/*Ec* , is assumed due to bond to equal the steel strain, *s*. Thus, the loss in prestress can be computed as *sEs*. An average value of prestress loss in pretensioned members because of elastic shortening is about 3% of the initial value.

An expression for the loss of prestress because of elastic shortening of the concrete can be derived as shown in the paragraphs to follow.

It can be seen that the compressive strain in the concrete from prestress must equal the lessening of the steel strain

$$\epsilon_c = \Delta \epsilon_s$$

These values can be written in terms of stresses as follows:

$$\frac{f_c}{E_c} = \frac{\Delta f_s}{E_s}$$

thus, we can write

$$\Delta f_s = \frac{E_s f_c}{E_c} = n f_c$$

where *fc* is the stress in the concrete at the level of the tendon centroid after transfer of stresses from the cables.

If we express *fs* as being the initial tendon stress, *fsi* , minus the tendon stress after transfer, we can write

$$f_{si} - f_s = nf_c$$

Then, letting *P*<sup>0</sup> be the initial total cable stress and *Pf* the stress afterward, we obtain

$$\begin{aligned} P_0 - P_f &= n \frac{P_f}{A_c} A_{ps} \\ P_0 &= n \frac{P_f}{A_c} A_{ps} + P_f \\ P_0 &= P_f \left( \frac{n A_{ps}}{A_c} + 1 \right) = \frac{P_f}{A_c} (n A_{ps} + A_c) \end{aligned}$$

Then

$$f_c = \frac{P_0}{A_c + A_{ps}} = \text{approximately } \frac{P_0}{A_g}$$

and finally

$$\Delta f_s = n f_c = \frac{n P_0}{A_g}$$

a value that can easily be calculated.

For posttensioned members, the situation is a little more involved because it is rather common to stress a few of the strands at a time and connect them to the end plates. As a result, the losses vary, with the greatest losses occurring in the first strands stressed and the least losses occurring in the last strands stressed. For this reason, an average loss may be calculated for the different strands. Losses from elastic shortening average about 0.5% for posttensioned members. It is, by the way, often possible to calculate the expected losses in each set of tendons and overstress them by that amount so the net losses will be close to zero.

#### Shrinkage and Creep of the Concrete

The losses in prestressing because of the shrinkage and creep in the concrete are quite variable. For one thing, the amount of shrinkage that occurs in concrete varies from almost zero up to about 0.0005 in./in. (depending on dampness and on the age of the concrete when it is loaded), with an average value of about 0.0003 in./in. being the usual approximation.

The loss in prestress from shrinkage can be said to equal  $\epsilon_{sh}E_s$ , where  $\epsilon_{sh}$  is the shrinkage strain of the concrete. A recommended value of  $\epsilon_{sh}$  is given in Zia et al.; it is to be determined by taking the basic shrinkage strain times a correction factor based on the volume (V)-to-surface (S) ratio times a relative humidity correction (H).<sup>3</sup>

$$\epsilon_{sh} = (0.00055) \left( 1 - 0.06 \frac{V}{S} \right) (1.5 - 0.15H)$$

Should the member be posttensioned, an additional multiplier is provided in Zia et al. to take into account the time between the end of the moist curing until the prestressing forces are applied.

The amount of creep in the concrete depends on several factors, which have been previously discussed in this text and can vary from one to five times the instantaneous elastic shortening. Prestress forces are usually applied to pretensioned members much earlier in the age of the concrete than for posttensioned members. Pretensioned members are normally cast in a bed at the prestress yard, where the speed of production of members is an important economic matter. The owner wants to tension the steel, place the concrete, and take the members out of the prestress bed as quickly as the concrete gains sufficient strength so that work can start on the next set of members. As a result, creep and shrinkage are larger, as are the resulting losses. Average losses are about 6% for pretensioned members and about 5% for posttensioned members.

The losses in cable stresses due to concrete creep strain can be determined by multiplying an experimentally determined creep coefficient  $C_t$  by  $nf_c$ .

$$\Delta f_s = C_t n f_c$$

In Zia et al., a value of  $C_t = 2.0$  is recommended for pretensioned sections, while 1.6 is recommended for posttensioned ones. These values should be reduced by 20% if lightweight concrete is used. The value  $f_c$  is defined as the stress in the concrete adjacent to the centroid of the tendons due to the initial prestress (-P/A) and due to the permanent dead loads that are applied to the member after prestressing (-Pec/I), where e is measured from the centroid of the section to the centroid of the tendons.

#### **Relaxation or Creep in the Tendons**

The plastic flow or relaxation of steel tendons is quite small when the stresses are low, but the percentage of relaxation increases as stresses become higher. In general, the estimated losses run from about 2% to 3% of the initial stresses. The amount of these losses actually varies quite a bit for different steels and should be determined from test data available from the steel manufacturer in question. A formula is available with which this loss can be computed.

#### Slippage in Posttensioning End Anchorage Systems

When the jacks are released and the prestress forces are transferred to the end anchorage system, a little slippage of the tendons occurs. The amount of the slippage depends on the system used and tends to vary from about 0.10 in. to 0.20 in. Such deformations are quite important if the members and thus the tendons are short, but if they are long, the percentage is much less important.

#### Friction along the Ducts Used in Posttensioning

There are losses in posttensioning because of friction between the tendons and the surrounding ducts. In other words, the stress in the tendons gradually falls off as the distance from the tension points increases because of friction between the tendons and the surrounding material. These losses are the result of the so-called length and curvature effects.

The *length effect* is the friction that would have existed if the cable had been straight and not curved. Actually, it is impossible to have a perfectly straight duct in posttensioned construction, and the result is friction, called the length effect or sometimes the wobble effect. The magnitude of this friction is dependent on the stress in the tendons, their length, the workmanship for the particular member in question, and the coefficient of friction between the materials.

The curvature effect is the amount of friction that occurs in addition to the unplanned wobble effect. The resulting loss is due to the coefficient of friction between the materials caused by the pressure on the concrete from the tendons, which is dependent on the stress and the angle change in the curved tendons.

It is possible to reduce frictional losses substantially in prestressing by several methods. These include jacking from both ends, overstressing the tendons initially, and lubricating unbonded cables.

The ACI Code (18.6.2.2) requires that frictional losses for posttensioned members be computed with wobble and curvature coefficients experimentally obtained and verified during the prestressing operation. Furthermore, the code provides Equations 18-1 and 18-2 (in Section 18.6.2.1) for making the calculations. The ACI Commentary (R18.6.2) provides values of the friction coefficients for use in the equations.

### **Ultimate Strength of Prestressed Sections**

Considerable emphasis is given to the ultimate strength of prestressed sections, the objective being to obtain a satisfactory factor of safety against collapse. You might wonder why it is necessary in prestress work to consider both working-stress and ultimate-strength situations. The answer lies in the tremendous change that occurs in a prestressed member's behavior after tensile cracks occur. Before the cracks begin to form, the entire cross section of a prestressed member is effective in resisting forces, but after the tensile cracks begin to develop, the cracked part is not effective in resisting tensile forces. Cracking is usually assumed to occur when calculated tensile stresses equal the modulus of rupture of the concrete (about 7.5 $\sqrt{f_c}$ ).

Another question that might enter your mind at this time is this: What effect do the prestress forces have on the ultimate strength of a section? The answer to the question is quite simple. An ultimate-strength analysis is based on the assumption that the prestressing strands are stressed above their yield point. If the strands have yielded, the tensile side of the section has cracked and the theoretical ultimate resisting moment is the same as for a nonprestressed beam constructed with the same concrete and reinforcing.

The theoretical calculation of ultimate capacities for prestressed sections is not as routine as it is for ordinary reinforced concrete members. The high-strength steels from which prestress tendons are manufactured do not have distinct yield points. Despite this fact, the strength method for determining the ultimate moment capacities of sections checks rather well with load tests as long as the steel percentage is sufficiently small as to ensure a tensile failure and as long as bonded strands are being considered.

In the expressions used here,  $f_{ps}$  is the average stress in the prestressing steel at the design load. This stress is used in the calculations because the prestressing steels usually used in prestressed beams do not have well-defined yield points (i.e., the flat portions that are common to stress–strain curves for ordinary structural steels). Unless the yield points of these steels are determined from detailed studies, their values are normally specified. For instance, the ACI Code (18.7.2) states that the following approximate expression may be used for calculating  $f_{ps}$ . In this expression,  $f_{pu}$  is the ultimate strength of the prestressing steel,  $\rho_p$  is the percentage of prestress reinforcing  $A_{ps}/bd_p$ , and  $f_{se}$  is the effective stress in the prestressing steel after losses. If more accurate stress values are available, they may be used instead of the specified values. In no case may the resulting values be taken as more than the specified yield strength  $f_{pv}$ , or  $f_{se}$  + 60,000. For bonded members,

$$f_{ps} = f_{pu} \left( 1 - \frac{\gamma_p}{\beta_1} \left[ \rho_p \frac{f_{pu}}{f_c'} + \frac{d}{d_p} \left( \omega - \omega' \right) \right] \right) \quad \text{if } f_{se} \ge 0.5 f_{pu} \quad \text{(ACI Equation 18-3)}$$

where  $\gamma_p$  is a factor for the type of prestress tendon whose values are specified in ACI Section 18.0 ( $\gamma_p = 0.55$  for  $f_{py}/f_{pu}$  not less than 0.80, 0.40 for  $f_{py}/f_{pu}$  not less than 0.85, and 0.28 for  $f_{py}/f_{pu}$  not less than 0.90),  $d_p =$  distance from the extreme compression fiber to the centroid of the prestress reinforcement,  $\omega = \rho f_v/f_c'$ , and  $\omega' = \rho' f_v/f_c'$ .

If any compression reinforcing is considered in calculating  $f_{ps}$ , the terms in brackets may not be taken as less than 0.17 (see Commentary R18.7.2). Should compression reinforcing be taken into account and if the term in brackets is small, the depth to the neutral axis will be small, and thus the compression reinforcing will not reach its yield stress. For this situation, the results obtained with ACI Equation 18-3 are not conservative, thus explaining why the ACI provides the 0.17 limit.

Should the compression reinforcing be neglected in using the equation,  $\omega'$  will equal zero and the term in brackets may be less than 0.17. Should d' be large, the strain in the compression steel may be considerably less than the yield strain, and as a result the compression steel will not influence  $f_{ps}$  as favorably as implied by the equation. As a result, ACI Equation 18-3 may be used only for beams in which  $d' \leq 0.15 d_p$ .

For unbonded members with span to depth  $\leq 35$ ,

$$f_{ps} = f_{se} + 10,000 + \frac{f'_c}{100\rho_p}$$
 but not greater than  $f_{py}$  or  $(f_{se} + 60,000)$  (ACI Equation 18-4)

For unbonded members with span to depth > 35.

$$f_{ps} = f_{se} + 10,000 + \frac{f'_c}{300\rho_p}$$
 (ACI Equation 18-5)

However,  $f_{ps}$  may not exceed  $f_{pv}$ , or  $f_{se} + 30,000$ .

As in reinforced concrete members, the amount of steel in prestressed sections is limited to ensure tensile failures. The limitation rarely presents a problem except in members with very small amounts of prestressing or in members that have not only prestress strands but also some regular reinforcing bars.

Example 19.3 illustrates the calculations involved in determining the permissible ultimate capacity of a rectangular prestressed beam. Some important comments about the solution and about ultimate-moment calculations in general are made at the end of the example.

#### Example 19.3

Determine the permissible ultimate moment capacity,  $\phi M_n$ , of the prestressed bonded beam of Figure 19.9 if  $f_{py}$  is 240,000 psi,  $f_{pu}$  is 275,000 psi, and  $f'_c$  is 5000 psi.

#### SOLUTION

#### Approximate Value of $f_{ps}$ from ACI Code

$$\rho_p = \frac{A_{ps}}{bd_p} = \frac{1.40 \text{ in.}^2}{(12 \text{ in.})(21.5 \text{ in.})} = 0.00543$$

$$\frac{f_{py}}{f_{py}} = \frac{240,000 \text{ psi}}{275,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.873$$

 $\therefore \gamma_p = 0.40$ , as given immediately after the presentation of ACI Equation 18-3 earlier in this section.

 $f_{
m ps}=$  estimated stress in prestressed reinforcement at nominal strength. Note that  $eta_1=0.80$ for 5000 psi concrete and d, the distance from the extreme compression fiber of the beam to the centroid of any nonprestressed tension reinforcement, is zero since there is no such reinforcement in this beam.

$$f_{ps} = f_{pu} \left\{ 1 - \frac{\gamma_p}{\beta_1} \left[ \rho_p \frac{f_{pu}}{f_c'} + \frac{d}{d_p} \left( \omega - \omega' \right) \right] \right\}$$

$$= 275 \text{ ksi } \left\{ 1 - \frac{0.40}{0.80} \left[ 0.00543 \left( \frac{275 \text{ ksi}}{5 \text{ ksi}} \right) + 0 \right] \right\} = 233.9 \text{ ksi}$$

#### **Moment Capacity**

$$a = \frac{A_{ps}f_{ps}}{0.85f'_{c}b} = \frac{(1.40 \text{ in.}^2)(233.9 \text{ ksi})}{(0.85)(5 \text{ ksi})(12 \text{ in.})} = 6.42 \text{ in.}$$

$$c = \frac{a}{\beta_1} = \frac{6.42 \text{ in.}}{0.80} = 8.03 \text{ in.}$$

$$\epsilon_t = \frac{d_p - c}{c} \quad 0.003 = \frac{21.5 \text{ in.} - 8.03 \text{ in.}}{8.03 \text{ in.}} (0.003) = 0.0050$$

 $\therefore$  The member is tension controlled and  $\phi = 0.9$ .

$$\phi M_n = \phi A_{ps} f_{ps} \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right) = (0.9) (1.40 \text{ in.}^2) (233.9 \text{ ksi}) \left( 21.5 \text{ in.} - \frac{6.42 \text{ in.}}{2} \right)$$
$$= 5390 \text{ in-k} = \frac{449.2 \text{ ft-k}}{2}$$

#### **Discussion**

The approximate value of  $f_{ps}$  obtained by the ACI formula is very satisfactory for all practical purposes. Actually, a slightly more accurate value of  $f_{ps}$  and, thus, of the moment capacity of the section can be obtained by calculating the strain in the prestress strands because of the prestressing and adding to it the strain from the ultimate moment. This latter strain can be determined from the values of a and the strain diagram, as frequently used in earlier chapters for checking to see if tensile failures control in reinforced concrete beams. With the total strain, a more accurate cable stress can be obtained by referring to the stress–strain curve for the prestressing steel being used. Such a curve is shown in Figure 19.10.

The analysis described herein is satisfactory for pretensioned beams or for bonded posttensioned beams but is not so good for unbonded posttensioned members. In these latter beams, the steel can slip with respect to the concrete; as a result, the steel stress is almost constant throughout the member. The calculations for  $M_u$  for such members are less accurate than for bonded members. Unless some ordinary reinforcing bars are added to these members, large cracks may form, which are not attractive and which can lead to some corrosion of the prestress strands.

If a prestressed beam is satisfactorily designed with service loads, then checked by strength methods and found to have insufficient strength to resist the factored loads ( $M_u = 1.2M_D + 1.6M_L$ ), nonprestressed reinforcement may be added to increase the factor of safety. The increase in T from these bars is assumed to equal  $A_s f_y$  (ACI 18.7.3). The code (18.8.2) further states that the total amount of prestressed and nonprestressed reinforcement shall be sufficient to develop an ultimate moment equal to at least 1.2 times the cracking moment of the section. This cracking moment is calculated with the modulus of rupture of the concrete, except for flexural members with a shear and flexural strength equal to at least twice that required to support the factored loads and for two-way, unbonded posttensioned slabs. This additional steel also will serve to reduce cracks. (The 1.2 requirement may be waived for two-way unbonded posttensioned slabs and for flexural members with shear and flexural strength at least equal to twice that required by ACI Section 9.2.)

#### 19.9 **Deflections**

The deflections of prestressed concrete beams must be calculated very carefully. Some members that are completely satisfactory in all other respects are not satisfactory for practical use because of the magnitudes of their deflections.

In previous chapters, one method used for limiting deflections was to specify minimum depths for various types of members (see Table 4.1 in Chapter 4). These minimum depths, however, are applicable only to nonprestressed sections. The actual deflection calculations are made as they are for members made of other materials, such as structural steel, reinforced concrete, and so on. However, the same problem exists for reinforced concrete members, and that is the difficulty of determining the modulus of elasticity to be used in the calculations. The modulus varies with age, with different stress levels, and with other factors. Usually the gross moments of inertia are used for immediate deflection calculations for members whose calculated extreme fiber stresses at service loads in the precompressed tensile zone are  $\leq 7.5\sqrt{f_c'}$  (ACI 18.3.3). Transformed I values may be used for other situations, as described in ACI Sections 18.3.3, 18.3.4, and 18.3.5.

The deflection from the force in a set of straight tendons is considered first in this section, with reference being made to Figure 19.11(a). The prestress forces cause a negative moment equal to Pe and, thus, an upward deflection or camber of the beam. The centerline deflection can be calculated by taking moments at the point desired when the conjugate beam is loaded with the M/EI diagram. At the centerline the deflection equals

$$-\left(\frac{Pe\ell}{2EI}\right)\left(\frac{\ell}{2} - \frac{\ell}{4}\right) = -\frac{Pe\ell^2}{8EI} \uparrow$$

Should the cables not be straight, the deflection will be different because of the different negative moment diagram produced by the cable force. If the cables are bent down or curved, as shown in parts (b) and (c) of Figure 19.11, the conjugate beam can again be applied to compute the deflections. The resulting values are shown in the figure.

FIGURE 19.11 Deflections in prestressed beams.

The deflections from the tendon stresses will change with time. First of all, the losses in stress in the prestress tendons will reduce the negative moments they produce and, thus, the upward deflections. The long-term compressive stresses in the bottom of the beam from the prestress negative moments will cause creep and, therefore, increase the upward deflections.

In addition to the deflections caused by the tendon stresses, there are deflections from the beam's own weight and from the additional dead and live loads subsequently applied to the beam. These deflections can be computed and superimposed on the ones caused by the

![](_page_607_Figure_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 19.11 (continued)

tendons. Figure 19.11(d) shows the centerline deflection of a uniformly loaded simple beam obtained by taking moments at the centerline when the conjugate beam is loaded with the M/EI diagram.

Example 19.4 shows the initial and long-term deflection calculations for a rectangular pretensioned beam.

#### Example 19.4

The pretensioned rectangular beam shown in Figure 19.12 has straight cables with initial stresses of 175 ksi and final stresses after losses of 140 ksi. Determine the deflection at the beam centerline immediately after the cables are cut.  $E_c=4\times10^6$  psi. Assume the concrete is uncracked.

**FIGURE 19.12** Information for Example 19.4.

#### SOLUTION

$$I_g = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (12 \text{ in.}) (20 \text{ in.})^3 = 8000 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$e = 6 \text{ in.}$$

$$Bm \text{ weight} = \frac{(12 \text{ in.}) (20 \text{ in.})}{144 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}^2} (150 \text{ pcf}) = 250 \text{ lb/ft}$$

#### **Deflection Immediately After Cables Are Cut**

$$\delta \text{ due to cable} = -\frac{Pe\ell^2}{8EI} = -\frac{(1.2 \text{ in.}^2 \times 175,000 \text{ psi}) (6 \text{ in.}) (12 \text{ in/ft} \times 30 \text{ ft})^2}{(8) (4 \times 10^6 \text{ psi}) (8000 \text{ in.}^4)} = -0.638 \text{ in.} \uparrow$$

$$\delta \text{ due to beam weight} = +\frac{5w\ell^4}{384EI} = \frac{(5) \left(\frac{250 \text{ lb/ft}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) (12 \text{ in/ft} \times 30 \text{ ft})^4}{(384) (4 \times 10^6 \text{ psi}) (8000 \text{ in.}^4)} = \frac{+0.142 \text{ in.} \downarrow}{-0.496 \text{ in.} \uparrow}$$

$$\text{Total deflection} = -0.496 \text{ in.} \uparrow$$

#### **Additional Deflection Comments**

Long-term deflections can be computed as previously described in Chapter 6. From the preceding example, it can be seen that, not counting external loads, the beam is initially cambered upward by 0.496 in.; as time goes by, this camber increases because of creep in the concrete. Such a camber is often advantageous in offsetting deflections caused by the superimposed loads. In some members, however, the camber can be quite large, particularly for long spans and where lightweight aggregates are used. If this camber is too large, the results can be quite detrimental to the structure (warping of floors, damage to roofing, cracking and warping of partitions, etc.).

To illustrate one problem that can occur, it is assumed that the roof of a school is being constructed by placing 50-ft double T's made with a lightweight aggregate side by side over a classroom. The resulting cambers may be rather large, and, worse, they may not be equal in the different sections. It then becomes necessary to force the different sections to the same deflection and tie them together in some fashion so that a smooth surface is provided for roofing. Once the surface is even, the members may be connected by welding together metal inserts, such as angles that were cast in the edges of the different sections for this purpose.

Both reinforced concrete members and prestressed members with overhanging or cantilevered ends often have rather large deflections. The total deflections at the free end of these

members are the result of the sum of the normal deflections plus the effect of support rotations. This latter effect may frequently be the larger of the two, and, as a result, the sum of the two deflections may be so large as to affect the appearance of the structure detrimentally. For this reason, many designers try to avoid cantilevered members in prestressed construction.

#### 19.10 Shear in Prestressed Sections

Web reinforcement for prestressed sections is handled in a manner similar to that used for a conventional reinforced concrete beam. In the expressions that follow,  $b_w$  is the web width or the diameter of a circular section and  $d_p$  is the distance from the extreme fiber in compression to the centroid of the tensile reinforcement. Should the reaction introduce compression into the end region of a prestressed member, sections of the beam located at distances less than h/2from the face of the support may be designed for the shear computed at h/2, where h is the overall thickness of the member.

$$v_u = \frac{V_u}{\phi b_w d_p}$$

The code (11.3) provides two methods for estimating the shear strength that the concrete of a prestressed section can resist. There is an approximate method, which can be used only when the effective prestress force is equal to at least 40% of the tensile strength of the flexural reinforcement,  $f_{pu}$ , and a more detailed analysis, which can be used regardless of the magnitude of the effective prestress force. These methods are discussed in the paragraphs to follow.

### **Approximate Method**

With this method, the nominal shear capacity of a prestressed section can be taken as

$$V_c = \left(0.6\lambda\sqrt{f_c'} + \frac{700V_u d_p}{M_u}\right)b_w d \qquad (ACI Equation 11-9)$$

The code (11.3.2) states that regardless of the value given by this equation,  $V_c$  need not be taken as less than  $2\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}b_w d$ , nor may it be larger than  $5\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}b_w d$ . In this expression,  $V_u$ is the maximum design shear at the section being considered,  $M_u$  is the design moment at the same section occurring simultaneously with  $V_u$ , and d is the distance from the extreme compression fiber to the centroid of the prestressed tendons. The value of  $V_{\mu}d_{\nu}/M_{\mu}$  is limited to a maximum value of 1.0.

#### More Detailed Analysis

If a more detailed analysis is desired (it will have to be used if the effective prestressing force is less than 40% of the tensile strength of the flexural reinforcement), the nominal shear force carried by the concrete is considered to equal the smaller of  $V_{ci}$  or  $V_{cw}$ , to be defined here. The term  $V_{ci}$  represents the nominal shear strength of a member provided by the concrete when diagonal cracking results from combined shear and moment. The term  $V_{cw}$  represents the nominal shear strength of the member provided by the concrete when diagonal cracking results from excessive principal tensile stress in the concrete. In both expressions to follow, d is the distance from the extreme compression fiber to the centroid of the prestressed tendons or is 0.8h, whichever is greater (ACI 11.3.3.2).

The estimated shear capacity,  $V_{ci}$ , can be computed by the following expression, given by the ACI Code (11.3.3.1):

$$V_{ci} = 0.6\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}b_wd_p + V_d + \frac{V_iM_{cr}}{M_{\max}} \text{ but need not be taken as less than } 1.7\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}b_wd$$
 (ACI Equation 11-10)

In this expression,  $V_d$  is the shear at the section in question due to service dead load,  $M_{\text{max}}$  is the factored maximum bending moment at the section from externally applied design loads,  $V_i$  is the shear that occurs simultaneously with  $M_{\text{max}}$ , and  $M_{cr}$  is the cracking moment, which is to be determined as follows:

$$M_{cr} = \left(\frac{I}{y_t}\right) \left(6\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} + f_{pe} - f_d\right)$$
 (ACI Equation 11-11)

where

I = the moment of inertia of the section that resists the externally applied loads

 $y_t$  = the distance from the centroidal axis of the gross section (neglecting the reinforcing) to the extreme fiber in tension

 $f_{pe}$  = the compressive stress in the concrete from prestressing after all losses at the extreme fiber of the section where the applied loads cause tension

 $f_d$  = the stress from unfactored dead load at the extreme fiber where the applied loads cause tension

From a somewhat simplified principal tension theory, the shear capacity of a beam is equal to the value given by the following expression but need not be less than  $1.7\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}b_w d$ .

$$V_{cw} = \left(3.5\lambda\sqrt{f_c'} + 0.3f_{pc}\right)b_w d_p + V_p \tag{ACI Equation 11-12}$$

In this expression,  $f_{pc}$  is the calculated compressive stress (in pounds per square inch) in the concrete at the centroid of the section resisting the applied loads due to the effective prestress after all losses have occurred. (Should the centroid be in the flange,  $f_{pc}$  is to be computed at the junction of the web and flange.)  $V_p$  is the vertical component of the effective prestress at the section under consideration. Alternately, the code (11.3.3.2) states that  $V_{cw}$  may be taken as the shear force that corresponds to a multiple of dead load plus live load, which results in a calculated principal tensile stress equal to  $4\lambda\sqrt{f'_c}$  at the centroid of the member or at the intersection of the flange and web if the centroid falls in the web.

A further comment should be made here about the computation of  $f_{pc}$  for pretensioned members, since it is affected by the transfer length. The code (11.3.4) states that the transfer length can be taken as 50 diameters for strand tendons and 100 diameters for wire tendons. The prestress force may be assumed to vary linearly from zero at the end of the tendon to a maximum at the aforesaid transfer distance. If the value of h/2 is less than the transfer length, it is necessary to consider the reduced prestress when  $V_{cw}$  is calculated (ACI 11.3.4).

### 19.11 Design of Shear Reinforcement

Should the computed value of  $V_u$  exceed  $\phi V_c$ , the area of vertical stirrups (the code does not permit inclined stirrups or bent-up bars in prestressed members) must not be less than  $A_v$  as determined by the following expression from the code (11.4.7.2):

$$V_s = \frac{A_v f_y d}{s}$$
 (ACI Equation 11-15)

As in conventional reinforced concrete design, a minimum area of shear reinforcing is required at all points where  $V_u$  is greater than  $\frac{1}{2}\phi V_c$ . This minimum area is to be determined from the expression to follow if the effective prestress is less than 40% of the tensile strength of the flexural reinforcement (ACI Code 11.4.6.4):

$$A_{v \min} = 0.75 \sqrt{f_c'} \frac{b_w s}{f_{vt}}$$
 but shall not be less than  $\frac{50b_w s}{f_{vt}}$  (ACI Equation 11-13)

where  $b_w$  and s are in inches.

If the effective prestress is equal to or greater than 40% of the tensile strength of the flexural reinforcement, the following expression, in which  $A_{ps}$  is the area of prestressed reinforcement in the tensile zone, is to be used to calculate  $A_{\nu}$ :

$$A_{v \text{ min}} = \left(\frac{A_{ps}}{80}\right) \left(\frac{f_{pu}}{f_{yt}}\right) \left(\frac{s}{d}\right) \sqrt{\left(\frac{d}{b_w}\right)}$$
 (ACI Equation 11-14)

Section 11.4.5.1 of the ACI Code states that in no case may the maximum spacing exceed 0.75h or 24 in. Examples 19.5 and 19.6 illustrate the calculations necessary for determining the shear strength and for selecting the stirrups for a prestressed beam.

#### Example 19.5

Calculate the shearing strength of the section shown in Figure 19.13 at 4 ft from the supports, using both the approximate method and the more detailed method allowed by the ACI Code. Assume that the area of the prestressing steel is 1.0 in.2, the effective prestress force is 250 k, and  $f'_c = 4000$  psi, normal weight.

#### SOLUTION

#### **Approximate Method**

Beam weight = 
$$\frac{(12 \text{ in.})(24 \text{ in.})}{144 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}^2}(150 \text{ lb/ft}^3) = 300 \text{ plf}$$
  
 $w_u = (1.2)(0.9 \text{ klf} + 0.3 \text{ klf}) + (1.6)(2.1 \text{ klf}) = 4.8 \text{ k/ft}$   
 $V_u = (10 \text{ ft})(4.8 \text{ klf}) - (4 \text{ ft})(4.8 \text{ klf}) = 28.8 \text{ k}$

#### More Detailed Method

$$I = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (12 \text{ in.}) (24 \text{ in.})^3 = 13,824 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$y_t = 12 \text{ in.}$$

$$f_{pe} =$$
 compressive stress in concrete due to prestress after all losses 
$$= \frac{P}{A} + \frac{Pec}{I}$$

$$f_{pe} = \frac{250,000 \text{ lb}}{(12 \text{ in.})(24 \text{ in.})} + \frac{(250,000 \text{ lb})(6 \text{ in.})(12 \text{ in.})}{13,824 \text{ in.}^4} = 2170 \text{ psi}$$

$$M_d$$
 = dead load moment at 4-ft point = (10 ft) (1.2 klf) (4 ft) – (4 ft) (1.2 klf) (2 ft)  
= 38.4 ft-k

$$f_d = \frac{M_d y_t}{I} = \text{stress due to the dead load moment} = \frac{\text{(12 in/ft) (38,400 ft-lb) (12 in.)}}{13,824 in.^4}$$

$$\begin{split} M_{cr} &= \text{cracking moment} = \left(\frac{I}{y_t}\right) \left(6\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} + f_{pe} - f_d\right) \\ &= \left(\frac{13,824 \text{ in.}^4}{12 \text{ in.}}\right) \left[ (6) (1.0) \left(\sqrt{4000} \text{ psi} + 2170 \text{ psi} - 400 \text{ psi} \right) \right] = 2,476,193 \text{ in-lb} \\ &= 206,349 \text{ ft-lb} \end{split}$$

$$\begin{split} w_u & \text{ not counting beam weight } = (1.2) \, (1.2 \, \text{klf} - 0.3 \, \text{klf}) + (1.6) \, (2.1 \, \text{klf}) = 4.44 \, \text{k/ft} \\ M_{\text{max}} &= (10 \, \text{ft}) \, (4.44 \, \text{klf}) \, (4 \, \text{ft}) - (4 \, \text{ft}) \, (4.44 \, \text{klf}) \, (2 \, \text{ft}) = 142.08 \, \text{ft-k} = 142,080 \, \text{ft-lb} \\ V_i & \text{because of } w_u \text{ occurring same time as } M_{\text{max}} &= (10 \, \text{ft}) \, (4.44 \, \text{klf}) - (4 \, \text{ft}) \, (4.44 \, \text{klf}) \\ &= 26.64 \, \text{k} = 26,640 \, \text{lb} \\ V_d &= \text{dead load shear} = (10 \, \text{ft}) \, (1.2 \, \text{klf}) - (4 \, \text{ft}) \, (1.2 \, \text{klf}) = 7.2 \, \text{k} = 7200 \, \text{lb} \\ d &= 24 \, \text{in.} - 3 \, \text{in.} - 3 \, \text{in.} = 18 \, \text{in. or} \, (0.8) \, (24) = 19.2 \, \text{in.} \\ V_{ci} &= 0.6 \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_w d_p + V_d + \frac{V_i M_{cr}}{M_{\text{max}}} & \text{(ACI Equation 11-10)} \\ &= (0.6) \, (1.0) \, (\sqrt{4000} \, \text{psi}) \, (12 \, \text{in.}) \, (19.2 \, \text{in.}) + 7200 \, \text{lb} + \frac{(26,640 \, \text{lb}) \, (206,349 \, \text{ft-lb})}{142,080 \, \text{ft-lb}} \\ &= 54,634 \, \text{lb} \leftarrow \end{split}$$

but need not be less than  $(1.7)(1.0)(\sqrt{4000} \text{ psi})(12 \text{ in.})(19.2 \text{ in.}) = 24,772 \text{ lb}$ 

#### Computing V<sub>cw</sub>

 $f_{\rm pc} = {\rm calculated}$  compressive stress in psi at the centroid of the concrete because of the effective prestress

$$=\frac{250,000 \text{ lb}}{(12 \text{ in.})(24 \text{ in.})}=868 \text{ psi}$$

$$V_{p}=\text{ vertical component of effective prestress at section}=\frac{9 \text{ in.}}{\sqrt{9 \text{ in.}^{2}+72 \text{ in.}^{2}}}(250,000 \text{ lb})$$

$$=\left(\frac{9 \text{ in.}}{72.56 \text{ in.}}\right)(250,000 \text{ lb})=31,009 \text{ lb}$$

$$V_{cw}=(3.5\lambda\sqrt{f_{c}'}+0.3f_{pc})b_{w}d+V_{p} \qquad \qquad \text{(ACI Equation 11-12)}$$

$$=(3.5)(1.0)(\sqrt{4000} \text{ psi}+0.3\times868 \text{ psi})(12 \text{ in.})(19.2 \text{ in.})+31,009 \text{ lb}=142,006 \text{ lb}$$

Using Lesser of  $V_{ci}$  or  $V_{cw}$ 

$$V_c = 54,634 \text{ lb}$$

#### Example 19.6

Determine the spacing of #3 \( \text{stirrups} \) required for the beam of Example 19.5 at 4 ft from the end support if  $f_{pu}$  is 250 ksi for the prestressing steel and  $f_v$  for the stirrups is 40 ksi. Use the value of  $V_c$  obtained by the approximate method, 54,634 lb.

#### SOLUTION

$$\begin{aligned} w_u &= (1.2) \, (1.2 \text{ klf}) + (1.6) \, (2.1 \text{ klf}) = 4.8 \text{ k/ft} \\ V_u &= (10 \text{ ft}) \, (4.8 \text{ klf}) - (4 \text{ ft}) \, (4.8 \text{ klf}) = 28.8 \text{ k} \\ \phi V_c &= (0.75) \, (54,634 \text{ lb}) = 40,976 \text{ lb} \\ &> V_u = 28,800 \text{ lb} \\ V_u &> \frac{\phi V_c}{2} = 20,488 \text{ lb} < \phi V_c \end{aligned}$$

A minimum amount of reinforcement is needed.

Since effective prestress is greater than 40% of tensile strength of reinforcing,

$$A_{v} = \left(\frac{A_{ps}}{80}\right) \left(\frac{f_{pu}}{f_{yt}}\right) \left(\frac{s}{d}\right) \sqrt{\left(\frac{d}{b_{w}}\right)}$$
 (ACI Equation 11-14) 
$$(2) (0.11) = \left(\frac{1.0 \text{ in.}^{2}}{80}\right) \left(\frac{250,000 \text{ psi}}{40,000 \text{ psi}}\right) \left(\frac{s}{18 \text{ in.}}\right) \sqrt{\frac{18 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in.}}}$$
 
$$s = 41.38 \text{ in., but maximum } s = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (24 \text{ in.}) = 18 \text{ in.}$$
 Use 18 in.

### 19.12 Additional Topics

This chapter has presented a brief discussion of prestressed concrete. A number of other important topics have been omitted from this introductory material. Several of these items are briefly mentioned in the paragraphs that follow.

#### Stresses in End Blocks

The part of a prestressed member around the end anchorages of the steel tendons is called the *end block*. In this region, the prestress forces are transferred from very concentrated areas out into the whole beam cross section. It has been found that the length of transfer for posttensioned members is less than the height of the beam and in fact is probably much less.

For posttensioned members, there is direct-bearing compression at the end anchorage; therefore, solid end blocks are usually used there to spread out the concentrated prestress forces. To prevent bursting of the block, either wire mesh or a grid of vertical and horizontal reinforcing bars is placed near the end face of the beam. In addition, both vertical and horizontal reinforcing is placed throughout the block.

For pretensioned members where the prestress is transferred to the concrete by bond over a distance approximately equal to the beam depth, a solid end block is probably not necessary, but spaced stirrups are needed. A great deal of information on the subject of end block stresses for posttensioned and pretensioned members is available.<sup>4</sup>

#### **Composite Construction**

Precast prestressed sections are frequently used in buildings and bridges in combination with cast-in-place concrete. Should such members be properly designed for shear transfer so the two parts will act together as a unit, they are called *composite sections*. Examples of such members were previously shown in parts (e) and (f) of Figure 19.8. In composite construction, the parts that are difficult to form and that contain most of the reinforcing are precast, whereas the slabs and perhaps the top of the beams, which are relatively easy to form, are cast in place.

The precast sections are normally designed to support their own weights plus the green cast-in-place concrete in the slabs plus any other loads applied during construction. The dead and live loads applied after the slab hardens are supported by the composite section. The combination of the two parts will yield a composite section that has a very large moment of inertia and thus a very large resisting moment. It is usually quite economical to use (a) a precast prestressed beam made with a high-strength concrete and (b) a slab made with an ordinary grade of concrete. If this practice is followed, it will be necessary to account for the different moduli of elasticity of the two materials in calculating the composite properties (thus it becomes a transformed area problem).

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>4</sup> Nawy, Prestressed Concrete, p. 173.

### **Continuous Members**

Continuous prestressed sections may be cast in place completely with their tendons running continuously from one end to the other. It should be realized for such members that where the service loads tend to cause positive moments, the tendons should produce negative moments and vice versa. This means that the tendons should be below the member's center of gravity in normally positive moment regions and above the center of gravity in normally negative moment regions. To produce the desired stress distributions, it is possible to use curved tendons and members of constant cross section or straight tendons with members of variable cross section. In Figure 19.14, several continuous beams of these types are shown.

Another type of continuous section that has been used very successfully in the United States, particularly for bridge construction, involves the use of precast prestressed members made into continuous sections with cast-in-place concrete and regular reinforcing steel. Figure 19.14(d) shows such a case. For such construction, the precast section resists a portion of the dead load, while the live load and the dead load that is applied after the cast-in-place concrete hardens are resisted by the continuous member.

### **Partial Prestressing**

During the early days of prestressed concrete, the objective of the designer was to proportion members that could never be subject to tension when service loads were applied. Such members are said to be *fully prestressed*. Subsequent investigations of fully prestressed members have shown that they often have an appreciable amount of extra strength. As a result, many designers now believe that certain amounts of tensile stresses can be permitted under service loads. Members that are permitted to have some tensile stresses are said to be *partially prestressed*.

A major advantage of a partially prestressed beam is a decrease in camber. This is particularly important when the beam load or the dead load is quite low compared to the total design load.

To provide additional safety for partially prestressed beams, it is common practice to add some conventional reinforcement. This reinforcement will increase the ultimate flexural strength of the members as well as help to carry the tensile stresses in the beam.5
