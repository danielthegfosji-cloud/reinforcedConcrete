# 14.7 Approximate Analysis of Continuous Frames for Vertical Loads

Statically indeterminate structures may be analyzed "exactly" or "approximately." Some approximate methods involving the use of simplifying assumptions are presented in this section. Despite the increased use of computers for making "exact" analyses, approximate methods are used about as much or more than ever, for several reasons. These include the following:

- 1. The structure may be so complicated that no one who has the knowledge to make an "exact" analysis is available or no suitable computer software is available.
- 2. For some structures, either method may be subject to so many errors and imperfections that approximate methods may yield values as accurate as those obtained with an "exact" analysis. A specific example is the analysis of a building frame for wind loads where

the walls, partitions, and floors contribute an indeterminate amount to wind resistance. Wind forces calculated in the frame by either method are not accurate.

- 3. To design the members of a statically indeterminate structure, it is sometimes necessary to make an estimate of their sizes before structural analysis can begin by an exact method. Approximate analysis of the structure will yield forces from which reasonably good initial estimates can be made as to member sizes.
- 4. Approximate analyses are quite useful in rough-checking exact solutions.

From the discussion of influence lines in Section 14.3, you can see that unless a computer is used (a very practical alternative today), an exact analysis involving several different placements of the live loads would be a long and tedious affair. For this reason, it is common when a computer is not readily available to use some approximate methods of analysis, such as the ACI moment and shear coefficients, the equivalent rigid-frame method, the assumed point-of-inflection-location method, and others discussed in the pages to follow.

#### **ACI Coefficients for Continuous Beams and Slabs**

A very common method used for the design of continuous reinforced concrete structures involves the use of the ACI coefficients given in Section 8.3.3 of the code. These coefficients, which are reproduced in Table 14.1, provide estimated maximum shears and moments for buildings of normal proportions. The values calculated in this manner will usually be somewhat larger than those that would be obtained with an "exact" analysis. As a result, appreciable economy can normally be obtained by taking the time or effort to make such an analysis. In this regard, it should be realized that these coefficients are considered best applied to continuous frames having more than three or four continuous spans.

In developing the coefficients, the negative-moment values were reduced to take into account the usual support widths and also some moment redistribution, as described in Section 14.5 of this chapter. In addition, the positive-moment values have been increased somewhat to account for the moment redistribution. It will also be noted that the coefficients account for the fact that, in monolithic construction, the supports are not simple and moments are present at end supports, such as where those supports are beams or columns.

FIGURE 14.19 Moment envelopes for continuous slab constructed integrally with beams.

In applying the coefficients,  $w_u$  is the design load while  $\ell_n$  is the clear span for calculating positive moments and the average of the adjacent clear spans for calculating negative moments. These values can be applied only to members with approximately equal spans (the larger of two adjacent spans not exceeding the smaller by more than 20%) and for cases where the ratio of the uniform service live load to the uniform service dead load is not greater than three. In addition, the values are not applicable to prestressed concrete members. Should these limitations not be met, a more precise method of analysis must be used.

For the design of a continuous beam or slab, the moment coefficients provide in effect two sets of moment diagrams for each span of the structure. One diagram is the result of placing the live loads so that they will cause maximum positive moment out in the span, while the other is the result of placing the live loads so as to cause maximum negative moments at the supports. To be truthful, however, it is not possible to produce maximum negative moments at both ends of a span simultaneously. It takes one placement of the live loads to produce maximum negative moment at one end of the span and another placement to produce maximum negative moment at the other end. The assumption of both maximums occurring at the same time is on the safe side, however, because the resulting diagram will have greater critical values than are produced by either one of the two separate loading conditions.

The ACI coefficients give maximum points for a moment envelope for each span of a continuous frame. Typical envelopes are shown in Figure 14.19 for a continuous slab, which is assumed to be constructed integrally with its exterior supports, which are spandrel girders.

Example 14.1 presents the design of the slab of Figure 14.20 using the moment coefficients of the ACI Code. The calculations for this problem can be conveniently set up in some type of table, such as the one shown in Figure 14.21. For this particular slab, the authors used an arrangement of reinforcement that included bent bars. It is quite common, however, in slabs—particularly those 5 in. or less in thickness—to use straight bars only in the top and bottom of the slab.

#### Example 14.1

Design the continuous slab of Figure 14.20 for moments calculated with the ACI coefficients. The slab is to support a service live load of 165 psf and a superimposed dead load of 5 psf in addition to its own dead weight.  $f_c' = 3000$  psi and  $f_y = 40,000$  psi. The slab is to be constructed integrally with its spandrel girder supports, and the spandrel supports are 12 in. wide.

Minimum  $t$  for interior span =  $0.8 \frac{\ell}{28} = \frac{(0.8) (12 \text{ in/ft}) (13 \text{ ft } + 1 \text{ ft})}{28} = 4.80 \text{ in.}$

Computing moments, ρ values, *As* requirements, and selecting bars at each section, as shown in Figure 14.21.

For floor slabs, we are not concerned with the design of web reinforcing. For continuous beams, however, web reinforcing must be carefully designed. Such designs are based on the maximum shears occurring at various sections along the span.

From previous discussions, you will remember that to determine the maximum shear occurring at section 1–1 in the beam of Figure 14.22, the uniform dead load would extend all across the span while the uniform live load would be placed from the section to the most distant support.

If the live load is placed so as to cause maximum shears at various points along the span and the shear is calculated for each point, a maximum shear curve can be drawn. Practically speaking, however, it is unnecessary to go through such a lengthy process for buildings of normal proportions because the values that would be obtained do not vary significantly from the values given by the ACI Code, which are shown in Figure 14.23.

#### **Equivalent Rigid-Frame Method**

When continuous beams frame into and are supported by girders, the normal assumption made is that the girders provide only vertical support. Thus, they are analyzed purely as continuous beams, as shown in Figure 14.24. The girders do provide some torsional stiffness, and if the calculated torsional moments exceed  $\phi \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} (A_{cp}^2/\rho_{cp})$  as specified in ACI Section 11.6.1, they must be considered, as will be described in Chapter 15.

Where continuous beams frame into columns, the bending stiffnesses of the columns together with the torsional stiffnesses of the girders are of such magnitude that they must be considered. An approximate method frequently used for analyzing such reinforced concrete members is the *equivalent rigid-frame method*. In this method, which is applicable only to gravity loads, the loads are assumed to be applied only to the floor or roof under consideration and the far ends of the columns are assumed to be fixed, as shown in Figure 14.25. The sizes of the members are estimated, and an analysis is frequently made with moment distribution.

For this type of analysis, it is necessary to estimate the sizes of the members and compute their relative stiffness, or  $I/\ell$ , values. From these values, distribution factors can be computed and the method of moment distribution applied. The moments of inertia of both columns and beams are normally calculated on the basis of gross concrete sections, with no allowance made for reinforcing.

There is a problem involved in determining the moment of inertia to be used for continuous T beams. The moment of inertia of a T beam is much greater where there is positive moment with the flanges in compression than where there is negative moment with the flanges cracked because of tension. Because the moment of inertia varies along the span, it is necessary to use an equivalent value. A practice often used is to assume that the equivalent moment of inertia equals twice the moment of inertia of the web, assuming that the web depth equals the full effective depth of the beam. Some designers use other equivalent values, such as assuming an equivalent T section with flanges of effective widths equal to so many (say, two to six) times the web width. These equivalent sections can be varied over a rather wide range without appreciably affecting the final moments.

The ACI Code (8.9.2) states that for such an approximate analysis, only two live-load combinations need to be considered. These are (1) live load placed on two adjacent spans and (2) live load placed on alternate spans. Example 14.2 illustrates the application of the equivalent rigid-frame method to a continuous T beam.

Computer results appear to indicate that the model shown in Figure 14.25 (as permitted by the ACI Code) may not be trustworthy for unsymmetrical loading. Differential column shortening can completely redistribute the moments obtained from the model (i.e., positive moments can become negative moments). As a result, designers should take into account possible axial deformations in their designs.

#### Example 14.2

Using the equivalent rigid-frame method, draw the shear and moment diagrams for the continuous T beam of Figure 14.26. The beam is assumed to be framed into 16-in. x 16-in. columns and is to support a service dead load of 2.33 k/ft (including beam weight) and a service live load of 3.19 k/ft. Assume that the live load is applied in the center span only. The girders are assumed to have a depth of 24 in. and a web width of 12 in. Assume that the I of the T beam equals two times the I of its web.

#### SOLUTION

#### **Computing Fixed-End Moments**

$$w_u$$
 in first and third spans = (1.2) (2.33 klf) = 2.8 k/ft 
$$M_u = \frac{(2.8 \text{ klf}) (24 \text{ ft})^2}{12} = 134.4 \text{ ft-k}$$
 
$$w_u \text{ in center span} = (1.2) (2.33 \text{ klf}) + (1.6) (3.19 \text{ klf}) = 7.9 \text{ k/ft}$$
 
$$M_u = \frac{(7.9 \text{ klf}) (24 \text{ ft})^2}{12} = 379.2 \text{ ft-k}$$

#### **Computing Stiffness Factors**

$$I \text{ of columns} = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (16 \text{ in.}) (16 \text{ in.})^3 = 5461 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$k \text{ of columns} = \frac{I}{\ell} = \frac{5461 \text{ in.}^4}{12 \text{ ft}} = 455 \text{ in}^4/\text{ft}$$
Equivalent  $I \text{ of T beam} = (2) \left(\frac{1}{12}b_w h^3\right) = (2) \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (12 \text{ in.}) (24 \text{ in.})^3 = 27,648 \text{ in.}^4$ 

$$k \text{ of T beam} = \frac{27,648 \text{ in.}^4}{24 \text{ ft}} = 1152 \text{ in}^4/\text{ft}$$

### **Assumed Points of Inflection**

Another approximate method of analyzing statically indeterminate building frames is to assume the locations of the points of inflection in the members. Such assumptions have the effect of creating simple beams between the points of inflection in each span, and the positive moments in each span can be determined by statics. Negative moments occur in the girders between their ends and the points of inflection. They may be computed by considering the portion of each beam out to the point of inflection (P.I.) to be a cantilever. The shear at the end of each of the girders contributes to the axial forces in the columns. Similarly, the negative moments at the ends of the girders are transferred to the columns.

In Figure 14.29, beam *AB* of the building frame shown is analyzed by assuming points of inflection at the one-fifth points and assuming fixed supports at the beam ends.

### **14.8 Approximate Analysis of Continuous Frames for Lateral Loads**

Building frames are subjected to lateral loads as well as to vertical loads. The necessity for careful attention to these forces increases as buildings become taller. Buildings must not only have sufficient lateral resistance to prevent failure, but also must have sufficient resistance to deflections to prevent injuries to their various parts. Rigid-frame buildings are highly statically indeterminate; their analysis by "exact" methods (unless computers are used) is so lengthy as to make the approximate methods very popular.

The approximate method presented here is called the *portal method*. Because of its simplicity, it has probably been used more than any other approximate method for determining wind forces in building frames. This method, which was presented by Albert Smith in the *Journal of the Western Society of Engineers* in April 1915, is said to be satisfactory for most buildings up to 25 stories in height. Another method very similar to the portal method is the

cantilever method. It is thought to give slightly better results for high narrow buildings and can be used for buildings not in excess of 25 to 35 stories.6

The portal method is merely a variation of the method described in Section 14.7 for analyzing beams in which the location of the points of inflection was assumed. For the portal method, the loads are assumed to be applied at the joints only. If this loading condition is correct, the moments will vary linearly in the members, and points of inflection will be located fairly close to member midpoints.

No consideration is given in the portal method to the elastic properties of the members. These omissions can be very serious in unsymmetrical frames and in very tall buildings. To illustrate the seriousness of the matter, the changes in member sizes are considered in a very tall building. In such a building, there will probably not be a great deal of change in beam sizes from the top floor to the bottom floor. For the same loadings and spans, the changed sizes would be the result of the large wind moments in the lower floors. The change in column sizes from top to bottom, however, would be tremendous. The result is that the relative sizes of columns and beams on the top floors are entirely different from the relative sizes on the lower floors. When this fact is not considered, it causes large errors in the analysis.

In the portal method, the entire wind loads are assumed to be resisted by the building frames, with no stiffening assistance from the floors, walls, and partitions. Changes in the lengths of girders and columns are assumed to be negligible. They are not negligible, however, in tall slender buildings, the height of which is five or more times the least horizontal dimension.

If the height of a building is roughly five or more times its least lateral dimension, it is generally felt that a more precise method of analysis should be used. There are several approximate methods that make use of the elastic properties of structures and give values closely approaching the results of the "exact" methods. These include the factor method,7 the Witmer method of *K* percentages, and the Spurr method.8

The building frame shown in Figure 14.30 is analyzed by the portal method, as described in the following paragraphs.

At least three assumptions must be made for each individual portal or for each girder. In the portal method, the frame is theoretically divided into independent portals (Figure 14.31), and the following three assumptions are made:

- **1.** The columns bend in such a manner that there is a point of inflection at middepth.
- **2.** The girders bend in such a manner that there is a point of inflection at their centerlines.
- **3.** The horizontal shears on each level are arbitrarily distributed between the columns. One commonly used distribution (and the one illustrated here) is to assume that the shear divides among the columns in the ratio of one part to exterior columns and two parts to interior columns.

The reason for the ratio in assumption 3 can be seen in Figure 14.31. Each of the interior columns is serving two bents, whereas the exterior columns are serving only one. Another common distribution is to assume that the shear, *V*, taken by each column is in proportion to the floor area it supports. The shear distribution by the two procedures would be the same for a building with equal bays, but for one with unequal bays the results would differ, with the floor area method probably giving more realistic results.

#### **Frame Analysis by Portal Method**

The frame of Figure 14.30 is analyzed in Figure 14.32 on the basis of the preceding assumptions. The arrows shown on the figure give the direction of the girder shears and the column axial forces. You can visualize the stress condition of the frame if you assume that the wind is tending to push it over from left to right, stretching the left exterior columns and compressing the right exterior columns. Briefly, the calculations were made as follows:

**1.** *Column shears*—The shears in each column on the various levels were obtained first. The total shear on the top level is 15 k. Because there are two exterior and two interior columns, the following expression may be written:

$$x + 2x + 2x + x = 15 k$$
$$x = 2.5 k$$
$$2x = 5.0 k$$

The shear in column *CD* is 2.5 k, in *GH* it is 5.0 k, and so on. Similarly, the member shears were determined for the columns on the first and second levels, where the total shears are 75 k and 45 k, respectively.

**FI GU RE 14.32** Results of portal analysis.

- **2.** *Column moments*—The columns are assumed to have points of inflection at their middepths; therefore, their moments, top and bottom, equal the column shears times half the column heights.
- **3.** *Girder moments and shears*—At any joint in the frame, the sum of the moments in the girders equals the sum of the moments in the columns. The column moments have been previously determined. Beginning at the upper-left corner of the frame and working across from left to right, adding or subtracting the moments as the case may be, the girder moments were found in this order: *DH*, *HL*, *LP*, *CG*, *GK*, and so on. It follows that with points of inflection at girder centerlines, the girder shears equal the girder moments divided by half-girder lengths.
- **4.** *Column axial forces*—The axial forces in the columns may be directly obtained from the girder shears. Starting at the upper-left corner, the column axial force in *CD* is equal to the shear in girder *DH*. The axial force in column *GH* is equal to the difference between the two girder shears *DH* and *HL*, which equals zero in this case. (If the width of each of the portals is the same, the shears in the girder on one level will be equal and the interior columns will have no axial force, since only lateral loads are considered.)

### **14.9 Computer Analysis of Building Frames**

All structures are three-dimensional, but theoretical analyses of such structures by hand calculation methods are so lengthy as to be impractical. As a result, such systems are normally assumed to consist of two-dimensional or planar systems, and they are analyzed independently of each other. The methods of analysis presented in this chapter were handled in this manner.

Today's computers have greatly changed the picture, and it is now possible to analyze complete three-dimensional structures. As a result, more realistic analyses are available, and the necessity for high safety factors is reduced. The application of computers is not restricted merely to analysis; they are used in almost every phase of concrete work from analysis to design to detailing to specification writing to material take-offs to cost estimating and so on.

Another major advantage of computer analysis for building frames is that the designer is able to consider many different loading patterns quickly. The results are sometimes rather surprising.

### **14.10 Lateral Bracing for Buildings**

For the usual building, the designer will select relatively small columns. Although such a procedure results in more floor space, it also results in buildings with small lateral stiffnesses or resistance to wind and earthquake loads. Such buildings may have detrimental lateral deflections and vibrations during windstorms unless definite lateral stiffness or bracing is otherwise provided in the structure.

To provide lateral stiffness, it is necessary for the roof and floor slabs to be attached to rigid walls, stairwells, or elevator shafts. Sometimes structural walls, called *shear walls*, are added to a structure to provide the necessary lateral resistance. (The design of shear walls is considered in Chapter 18 of this text.) If it is not possible to provide such walls, stairwells or elevator shafts may be designed as large, box-shaped beams to transmit lateral loads to the supporting foundations. These members will behave as large cantilever beams. In designing such members, the designer should try to keep resistance symmetrical so as to prevent uneven lateral twisting or torsion in the structure when lateral loads are applied.9

### **14.11 Development Length Requirements for Continuous Members**

In Chapter 7, a general introduction to the subject of development lengths for simple and cantilever beams was presented. This section examines the ACI development length requirements for continuous members for both positive and negative reinforcing. After studying this information, the reader probably will be pleased to find at the end of this section a discussion of simplified design office practices for determining bar lengths.

### **Positive-Moment Reinforcement**

Section 12.11 of the code provides several detailed requirements for the lengths of positivemoment reinforcement. These are briefly summarized in the following paragraphs.

- **1.** At least one-third of the positive steel in simple beams and one-fourth of the positive steel in continuous members must extend uninterrupted along the same face of the member at least 6 in. in the support (12.11.1). The purpose of this requirement is to make sure that the moment resistance of a beam will not be reduced excessively in parts of beams where the moments may be changed due to settlements, lateral loads, and so on.
- **2.** The positive reinforcement required in the preceding paragraph must, *if the member is part of a primary lateral load resisting system*, be extended into the support a sufficient distance to develop the yield stress in tension of the bars at the face of the support. This requirement is included by the code (12.11.2) to ensure a ductile response to severe overstress, as might occur with moment reversal during an earthquake or explosion. As a result of this requirement, it is necessary to have bottom bars lapped at interior supports and to use additional embedment lengths and hooks at exterior supports.

<sup>9</sup> Leet, K., 1991, *Reinforced Concrete Design*, 2nd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill), pp. 453–454.

**3.** Section 12.11.3 of the code says that at simple supports and at points of inflection, the positive-moment tension bars must have their diameters limited to certain maximum sizes. The purpose of the limitation is to keep bond stresses within reason at these points of low moments and large shears. (It is to be remembered that when bar diameters are smaller, the bars have greater surface area in proportion to their cross-sectional areas. Thus, for bonding to concrete, the larger the bars' diameters, the larger must be their development lengths. This fact is reflected in the expressions for l*<sup>d</sup>* .) It has not been shown that long anchorage lengths are fully effective in developing bars in a short distance between a P.I. and a point of maximum bar stress, a condition that might occur in heavily loaded short beams with large bottom bars. It is specified that l*<sup>d</sup>* as computed by the requirements presented in Chapter 7 may not exceed the following:

$$\ell_d \le \frac{M_n}{V_u} + \ell_a$$
 (ACI Equation 12-5)

In this expression, *Mn* is the computed theoretical flexural strength of the member if all reinforcing in that part of the beam is assumed stressed to *fy* , and *Vu* is the factored shear at the section. At a support, l*<sup>a</sup>* is equal to the sum of the embedment length beyond the centerline of the support and the equivalent embedment length of any furnished hooks or mechanical anchorage. Headed and mechanically anchored deformed bars, which are permitted in Section 12.6 of the ACI Code, consist of bars or plates or angles or other pieces welded or otherwise attached transversely to the flexural bars in locations where sufficient anchorage length is not available. See Sections 1.15 and 7.15 of this text for details on headed anchorage. At a point of inflection, l*<sup>a</sup>* is equal to the larger of the effective depth of the member or 12*d* (ACI 12.11.3). When the ends of the reinforcement are confined by a compression reaction, such as when there is a column below but not when a beam frames into a girder, an increase of 30% in the value *Mn* /*Vu* to 1.3*Mn* /*Vu* is allowed. The values described here are summarized in Figure 14.33, which is similar to Figure R12.11.3 of the ACI Code. A brief numerical illustration for a simple end-supported beam is provided in Example 14.3.

#### Example 14.3

At the simple support shown in Figure 14.34, two uncoated #9 bars have been extended from the maximum moment area and into the support. Are the bar sizes satisfactory if  $f_y = 60$  psi,  $f_c' = 3$  ksi, b = 12 in., d = 24 in., and  $V_u = 65$  k; if normal sand-gravel concrete is used; and if the reaction is compressive? Assume cover for bars = 2 in. clear.

#### SOLUTION

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.85 f_c' b} = \frac{(2.00 \text{ in.}^2) (60 \text{ ksi})}{(0.85) (3 \text{ ksi}) (12 \text{ in.})} = 3.92 \text{ in.}$$

$$M_n = A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right) = (2.00 \text{ in.}^2) (60 \text{ ksi}) \left( 24 \text{ in.} - \frac{3.92 \text{ in.}}{2} \right) = 2644.8 \text{ in-k}$$

$$c = \text{side cover} = 2 \text{ in.} + \frac{1.128 \text{ in.}}{2} = 2.564 \text{ in.} \leftarrow$$

 $c = \text{one-half to c. to c. spacing of bars} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (12 \text{ in.} - 2 \times 2 \text{ in.} - 1.128 \text{ in.}) = 3.436 \text{ in.}$ 

Assume  $K_{tr} = 0$ .

$$\begin{split} \frac{\ell_d}{d_b} &= \frac{3}{40} \frac{f_y}{\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}} \frac{\Psi_{\rm t} \Psi_{\rm e} \Psi_{\rm s}}{c_b + K_{tr}} \\ &= \left(\frac{3}{40}\right) \left[\frac{60,000~{\rm psi}}{(1.0)\sqrt{3000}~{\rm psi}}\right] \frac{(1.0)\,(1.0)\,(1.0)}{2.564~{\rm in.} + 0} = 36.14~{\rm diameters} \\ \ell_d &= (36.14)\,(1.128~{\rm in.}) = 41~{\rm in.} \end{split}$$

Maximum permissible 
$$\ell_d=\frac{M_n}{V_u}+\ell_a$$
 
$$=(1.3)\left(\frac{2644.8~\text{in-k}}{65~\text{k}}\right)+7~\text{in.}=59.90~\text{in.}>41~\text{in.}$$

*Note*: If this condition has not been satisfied, the permissible value of  $\ell_d$  could have been increased by using smaller bars or by increasing the end anchorage,  $\ell_a$ , for example, by the use of hooks.

![](_page_480_Figure_11.jpeg)

**FIGURE 14.34** Support details for Example 14.3.

#### **Negative-Moment Reinforcement**

Section 12.12 of the code says that the tension reinforcement required by negative moments must be properly anchored into or through the supporting member. Section 12.12.1 of the code says that the tension in these negative bars shall be developed on each side of the section in question by embedment length, hooks, or mechanical anchorage. Hooks may be used because these are tension bars.

Section 12.10.3 of the code says that the reinforcement must extend beyond the point where it is no longer required for moment by a distance equal to the effective depth d of the member or 12 bar diameters, whichever is greater, except at the supports of simple beams or at the free ends of cantilevers. Section 12.12.3 of the code says that at least one-third of the total reinforcement provided for negative moment at the support must have an embedment length beyond the point of inflection no less than the effective depth of the member, 12 bar diameters, or one-sixteenth of the clear span of the member, whichever is greatest. The location of the point of inflection can vary for different load combinations; therefore, be certain to use the most critical case.

Example 14.4, which follows, presents a detailed consideration of the lengths required by the code for a set of straight negative-moment bars at an interior support of a continuous beam.

#### Example 14.4

At the first interior support of the continuous beam shown in Figure 14.35, six #8 straight uncoated top bars (4.71 in.2) are used to resist a moment  $M_{\nu}$  of 390 ft-k for which the calculated  $A_{\rm s}$  required is 4.24 in.<sup>2</sup> If  $f_{\rm v}=60$  ksi,  $f_{\rm c}'=3$  ksi, and normal sand-gravel concrete is used, determine the length of the bars as required by the ACI Code. The dimensions of the beam are  $b_w = 14$  in. and d = 24 in. Assume bar cover  $= 2d_b$  and clear spacing  $= 3d_b$ .

![](_page_481_Figure_8.jpeg)

**FIGURE 14.35** Continuous beam for Example 14.4.

Note: The six negative-tension bars are actually placed in one layer in the top of the beam, but they are shown for illustration purposes in Figures 14.35 and 14.36 as though they are arranged in three layers of two bars each. In the solution that follows, the "bottom" two bars are cut off first, at the point where the moment plus the required development length is furnished; the "middle" two are cut when the moment plus the needed development length permits; and the "top" two are cut off at the required distance beyond the P.I.

#### SOLUTION

1. Required development length

$$\begin{aligned} c_b &= \text{side cover} = (2)(1.0 \text{ in.}) + \frac{1.0 \text{ in.}}{2} = 2.5 \text{ in.} \\ c_b &= \text{one-half of c. to c. spacing of bars} = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)(1.0 \text{ in.}) + \left(\frac{1.0 \text{ in.}}{2}\right) = 2.0 \text{ in.} \leftarrow 0.0 \text{ in.} \end{aligned}$$

Assume  $K_{tr} = 0$ 

$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} = \left(\frac{3}{40}\right) \left[\frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{(1.0)\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}}\right] \frac{(1.3)(1.0)(1.0)}{\frac{2.0+0}{1.0}} = 53.4 \text{ diameters}$$

$$\ell_d = (53.41)(1.0 \text{ in.}) = 53.4 \text{ in.}$$
 Say 54 in. OK

- **2.** Section 12.12.3 of the code requires one-third of the bars to extend beyond P.I.  $(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ bars})$  for a distance equal to the largest of the following values (applies to "top" bars in figure).
  - (a) d of web = 24 in.
  - **(b)**  $12d_b = (12)(1 \text{ in.}) = 12 \text{ in.}$
  - (c)  $(\frac{1}{16})$  (24 ft × 12 in/ft) for 24 in. span = 18 in.
  - (d)  $(\frac{1}{16})$  (34 ft × 12 in/ft) for 34 in. span =  $25\frac{1}{2}$  in.

Use 24 in. for short span and  $25\frac{1}{6}$  in. for long span

- **3.** Section 12.10.3 of the code requires that the bars shall extend beyond the point where they are no longer required by moment for a distance equal to the greater of
  - (a) d = 24 in.
  - **(b)**  $12d_b = (12)(1 \text{ in.}) = 12 \text{ in.}$
- **4.** Section 12.3.3 says required  $\ell_d$  can be multiplied by  $A_{\rm s\ reqd}/A_{\rm s\ furn}$ . This applies only to the first bars cut off ("bottom" bars here).

Reduced 
$$\ell_d = (53.4 \text{ in.}) \left( \frac{4.24 \text{ in.}^2}{4.71 \text{ in.}^2} \right) = 48 \text{ in.}$$

5. In Figure 14.36, these values are applied to the bars in question and the results are given.

![](_page_483_Figure_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 14.36 Bar cutoff details for Example 14.4.

The structural designer is seldom involved with a fixed-moment diagram—the loads move and the moment diagram changes. Therefore, the code (12.10.3) says that reinforcing bars should be continued for a distance of 12 bar diameters or the effective depth of the member, whichever is greater (except at the supports of simple spans and the free ends of cantilevers), beyond their theoretical cutoff points.

As previously mentioned, the bars must be embedded a distance  $\ell_d$  from their point of maximum stress.

Next, the code (12.11.1) says that at least one-third of the positive steel in simple spans and one-fourth of the positive steel in continuous spans must be continued along the same face of the beam at least 6 in. into the support.

Somewhat similar rules are provided by the code (12.12.3) for negative steel. At least one-third of the negative steel provided at a support must be extended beyond its point of inflection a distance equal to one-sixteenth of the clear span or 12 bar diameters or the effective depth of the member, whichever is greatest. Other negative bars must be extended beyond their theoretical point of cutoff by the effective depth, 12 bar diameters and at least  $\ell_d$  from the face of the support.

**FI GU RE 14.37** Recommended bar details for continuous beams.

Trying to go through these various calculations for cutoff or bend points for all of the bars in even a modest-size structure can be a very large job. Therefore, the average designer or perhaps the structural draftsperson will cut off or bend bars by certain rules of thumb, which have been developed to meet the code rules described here. In Figure 14.37, a sample set of such rules is given for continuous beams. In the *CRSI Handbook*, <sup>10</sup> such rules are provided for several different types of structural members, such as solid one-way slabs, one-way concrete joists, two-way slabs, and so forth.
