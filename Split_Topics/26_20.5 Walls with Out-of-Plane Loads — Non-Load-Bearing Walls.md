# 20.5 Walls with Out-of-Plane Loads — Non-Load-Bearing Walls

A significant number of masonry walls are subjected to out-of-plane loads (wind and earth-quake) but do not have any external axial loads bearing on them. Picture a simple rectangular building, such as a convenience store, with a bar-joist roof. If the joist span in the north-south direction, then they bear on the masonry walls on the east and west end of the building. The walls on the north and south side have no bar joists bearing on them, hence they are considered non-load-bearing. Of course, they support their own weight and perhaps just a very small part of the roof load, but not much. The design of reinforced masonry walls with small or no axial load is virtually the same as the design of reinforced concrete one-way slabs. However, the slab stands up and spans vertically. The roof must provide lateral support at the top, and the footing must provide lateral support at the bottom.

Figure 20.1 shows the cross section of a wall with vertical reinforcing bars located in cells at a horizontal spacing, s. In this case, counting the seven cells from one bar to the next, the spacing would be  $7 \times 8$  in. = 56 in. The reason the spacing from center to center of each

cell is 8 in. is because the nominal length of a unit is 16 in., and there are normally two cells

A 12-in. width of the wall in Figure 20.1 is taken out and shown in Figure 20.2. This figure is comparable to Figure 2.11 in Chapter 2 but reflects the differences between ACI 318 and ACI 530. The differences are listed in Table 20.2.

Looking at Figure 20.2(b), the following equations can be developed. First, summing forces axially, C = T,

$$A_s f_v = 0.80 f'_m ab$$
 (Equation 20-1)

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.80 f'_m b}$$
 (Equation 20-2)

Then, summing moments about the compression force, C.

$$M_n = A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right)$$
 (Equation 20-3)

The strength reduction factor for reinforced masonry in flexure or combined axial load and flexure is  $\phi = 0.9$  and, as in reinforced concrete,  $M_u = \phi M_n$ . Therefore,

$$M_u = \phi M_n = \phi A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right)$$

Defining the reinforcement ratio,  $\rho$ , as it was in reinforced concrete design,  $\rho = A_s/bd$  and substituting into Equations 20.2 and 20.3 results in:

$$a = \frac{\rho df_y}{0.80f_m'}$$
 (Equation 20-4)

$$M_u = \phi \rho b df_y \left( d - \frac{\rho df_y}{1.60 f_m'} \right) = \phi f_y b d^2 \rho \left( 1 - \frac{\rho f_y}{1.60 f_m'} \right)$$
 (Equation 20-5)

Solving Equation 20.5 for  $\rho$ ,

$$\rho = \frac{0.80f'_m}{f_v} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2M_u}{0.80\phi f'_m b d^2}} \right)$$
 (Equation 20-6)

**TABLE 20.2** Comparison of ACI 318 and ACI 530 Stress-Blocks

|         | Limiting Compressive Strain | ressive Strain $eta_1$   |                     |  |  |
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--|--|

And solving Equation 20.5 for the parameter  $bd^2$ ,

$$bd^{2} = \frac{M_{u}}{\phi f_{y} \rho \left(1 - \frac{\rho f_{y}}{1.6 f'_{m}}\right)}$$
 (Equation 20-7)

The application of the above equations is illustrated in the examples that follow.

When selecting the bar size and spacing, based on the calculation of  $A_s$ , it is normally assumed that there is an 8-in. spacing from center to center of each cell. So when selecting a bar spacing, choose a value that is a multiple of 8 in. For example, if a theoretical spacing of 35.4 in. is calculated, a spacing of 32 in. would be selected.

#### Example 20.1

#### Design of a Non-Load-Bearing Wall - Reinforced with Out-of-Plane Loads

Design the single-story exterior wall shown, using the ACI 530 Code strength design provisions. Wind pressure and wind suction are 32 psf. There are no axial loads other than the wall's own weight. Use Grade 60 reinforcing steel, a unit strength of 1900 psi, and Type S masonry-cement mortar. Specify that the wall is fully grouted (i.e., all of the cells, including those between those containing reinforcing bars, are grouted).

#### SOLUTION

Treating the wall as simply supported, the moment at mid-height because of wind pressure or suction is

$$M_w = \frac{wh^2}{8} = \frac{(32 \text{ psf}) (18 \text{ ft})^2}{8} = 1296 \text{ ft-lb/ft}$$
  
= 15,552 in-lb/ft

The load factor for wind in the 2011 ACI 530 Code (taken from ASCE 7-10) is 1.0, therefore  $M_{IJ} = 1.0 M_{W} = 15,552$  in-lb/ft.

![](_page_628_Picture_13.jpeg)

Assume a nominal wall thickness of 8 in. ( $7\frac{5}{8}$  in. actual) resulting in d=7.625 in./2 = 3.81 in. Also, assume a 1-ft design strip width, as we did when designing one-way slabs made of reinforced concrete. Then b=12 in. and the moment  $M_{ij}=15,552$  in-lb. Then according to Equation 20.6,

$$\rho = \frac{0.80f'_m}{f_y} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2M_u}{0.80\phi f'_m b d^2}} \right)$$

$$= \frac{(0.80) (1500 \text{ psi})}{60,000 \text{ psi}} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2(15,552 \text{ in-lb})}{(0.80) (0.90) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.}) (3.81 \text{ in.})^2}} \right)$$

$$= 0.00173$$

 $A_s = \rho bd = (0.00173)(12 \text{ in.})(3.81 \text{ in.}) = 0.0789 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$ 

This is the area of reinforcing steel per foot of wall width, just as in the design of one-way slabs in Chapter 4.

This area per foot of wall width can be met with several bar sizes, using ratio and proportion:

$$\frac{s}{A_b} = \frac{12}{A_s}$$

where  $A_h$  is the area of the bar selected, s is the bar spacing, and  $A_s$  is the theoretical area per foot of wall width (0.0789 in<sup>2</sup>/ft) calculated in the previous step.

| Bar size designation                       | #3   | #4   | #5   | #6   |
|--------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|
| $A_b$ (in. <sup>2</sup> )                  | 0.11 | 0.20 | 0.31 | 0.44 |
| Theoretical spacing, $s = 12A_b/A_s$ (in.) | 16.7 | 30.4 | 47.1 | 66.9 |
| Rounded down to multiples of 8 in.         | 16   | 24   | 40   | 64   |

Select #5 at 40-in. centers. Place these bars vertically in every fifth cell.

Check the maximum reinforcement provision:

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.80 f_m' b} = \frac{(0.31 \text{ in.}^2) (60,000 \text{ lb/in.}^2)}{0.80 (1500 \text{ lb/in.}^2) (40 \text{ in.})} = 0.3875 \text{ in.}$$

$$c = \frac{a}{0.8} = \frac{0.3875}{0.8} = 0.484 \text{ in.}$$

From Figure 20.2(a) and similar triangles

$$\epsilon_s = \frac{d-c}{c} \epsilon_{mu} = \frac{3.81 - 0.484}{0.484} (0.0025) = 0.0172$$

Yield strain for a Grade 60 bar is

$$\epsilon_y = \frac{f_y}{E_s} = \frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{29,000,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.00207$$

Since the strain in the flexural tensile reinforcing steel is over eight times  $\epsilon_{\rm v}$  (it has to be only one and a half times  $\epsilon_{\nu}$ ), the wall is quite ductile and the provisions of ACI 530 Section 3.3.3.5 are met. This provision becomes more complex with load-bearing walls because of the effect of axial load on the strain in the tension steel. It will be covered later under load-bearing walls.

Note that an 8-in, wall is not necessary for this problem. Rather than just guessing a wall thickness, a rational approach is available. This approach is very similar to that used in reinforced concrete beam and one-way slab design. However, this method still requires making an assumption—in this case,  $\rho$ . Usually masonry walls have a value of  $\rho$  somewhere between 0.001 and 0.004. So, assume  $\rho=0.002$ . Substituting this value into Equation 20.7,

$$bd^2 = \frac{M_u}{\phi f_y \rho \left(1 - \frac{\rho f_y}{1.6 f_m'}\right)} = \frac{15,552 \text{ in-lb}}{(0.9) (60,000 \text{ psi}) (0.002) \left[1 - \frac{(0.002) (60,000 \text{ psi})}{(1.6) (1500 \text{ psi})}\right]} = 151.6 \text{ in.}^3$$

Since b = 12 in. because we assumed a 1-ft design width,

$$d = \sqrt{\frac{151.6 \text{ in.}^3}{12 \text{ in.}}} = 3.55 \text{ in.}$$

If the steel is placed in the center of the wall such that d = t/2, then a wall thickness of twice the theoretical value of d is needed. Hence,  $t \ge 2 \times 3.55$  in. = 7.10 in. The designer would then select the next available thickness above 7.10 in., or 8 in. This method is given only to show the student how to rationally select wall thicknesses. However, since it is just as easy to just guess the thickness, rather than  $\rho$ , the authors prefer assuming wall thickness at the beginning.

If a 6-in. wall had been selected, the resulting area of reinforcing steel,  $A_{\rm s}$ , would have been 0.112 in²/ft (compared to 0.0789 in²/ft for the 8-in. wall). This area can be satisfied using #5 at 33.2 in., which rounds down to 32 in. The resulting steel strain,  $\epsilon_{\rm s}$ , is 0.00912, which exceeds one and a half times  $\epsilon_{\rm y}$ , so the wall is ductile, though not as ductile as the 8-in. wall. The authors prefer using the 8-in. wall thickness simply because 6-in. units have somewhat smaller cells and are harder to reinforce and grout. Either solution meets the code.

Shear capacity of walls loaded out of plane is almost never an issue. Generally speaking, the shear capacity is many times the demand. For that reason, only shear walls and lintels, which are covered later in this chapter, are designed for shear.

The wall just designed was assumed to be fully grouted. If it had been *partially grouted*, much more complicated equations that involve nonrectangular compression zones are involved. However, just as in the case of design of T beams in Chapter 5, these more complex equations apply only if the neutral axis is deep enough to go into the webs. In masonry design, if the neutral axial depth, c, does not exceed the face-shell thickness ( $1\frac{1}{4}$  in. for 8 in. and larger wall thickness), then the equations for fully grouted walls apply also to partially grouted walls. In the preceding solution, in which an 8-in. wall with #5 bars at 40 in. was chosen, the value of c was 0.484 in., much less than the face-shell thickness. Therefore, this solution would also apply to a partially grouted wall. Partial grout means that only the reinforced cells are grouted, not the ones in between. As a practical matter, in order to contain the grout within the reinforced cell, the webs on each side of each grouted cells must be mortared. This means that the use of face-shell bedding must be modified accordingly, if partial grout is specified.

### 20.6 Masonry Lintels

Most masonry walls contain openings such as doors and windows. The loads above these openings must span these openings to be supported by the adjacent masonry. The beam that spans over such an opening, regardless of what it is made of, is called a *lintel*. Lintels can be made of structural steel, precast concrete, or masonry. This section discusses design and construction of masonry lintels. Many designers choose to use structural steel or precast concrete lintels simply because they are unfamiliar with the design of masonry lintels. An illustration of a masonry lintel is shown in Figure 20.3. The large door opening shown might be a garage door, so the span can be quite large. This illustration shows a three-course lintel, but the number of courses could range from one to the total number of courses available above the door opening. The lintel must be fully grouted (ACI 530 Section 3.3.4.2.4), but the masonry above it need

not be. The lintel is shown to have a span larger than the clear opening, l*<sup>n</sup>* . The additional span represents the bearing length, which ACI 530 (1.13.1.3) requires to be at least 4 in. In most cases, the bearing length is 8 in. for CMU construction. The lintel must support its own weight, the weight of masonry above it, and any loads on top of the wall. For example, it would certainly be possible to have bar joists bearing on top of the wall for its entire length. The lintel would then have to support the load they impose on the top of the wall.

Lintels must be designed to resist bending and shear, and often their deflection must be calculated and compared to the limit of l/600 under dead plus live unfactored load (ACI 530 Section 1.13.1.4.1).

All of the equations developed for non–load-bearing walls (Eq. 20.1–20.7) apply equally to lintels. The main difference is that the value of *d* for lintels is not half of the lintel depth but rather is more on the order of reinforced concrete beams. The steel is usually placed as close to the bottom of a lintel as cover requirements permit. Sometimes, however, instead of using the U-shaped unit shown in the bottom course in Figure 20.3, Section A–A, the designer may use units with half-high webs as described earlier when discussing bond beams. These units do not physically allow the steel to be placed close to the bottom of the lintel because the webs are in the way. In this case, the steel has approximately a 4-in. cover of masonry below it. Also, these types of units have vertical cells that have to be "dammed up" to contain the grout that is placed in them. This dam is often provided using a 2 × 8 wooden form that is also there to support the lintel during construction. If the units with half-high webs are inverted, then the reinforcing steel can be placed as close to the bottom as cover limits allow.

### **Shear Design of Lintels**

Shear design of masonry lintels by strength design is very similar to that of reinforced concrete beams covered in Chapter 7. While it is possible to provide stirrups in masonry lintels, it is difficult and the authors do not recommend it. Usually if you just make the lintel deeper, no stirrups will be required. For this reason, and for reasons of space limitations, the design of stirrups for lintels is not discussed further. The strength reduction factor for shear for reinforced masonry is φ = 0.8.

If no shear reinforcement is provided, then the masonry must resist the design shear, *Vu* . The masonry shear capacity is given by ACI 530 Equation 3-23,

$$V_{nm} = \left[4.0 - 1.75 \left(\frac{M_u}{V_u d}\right)\right] A_n \sqrt{f_m'} + 0.25 P_u$$

The value of *Mu* /*Vu dv* need not be taken greater than one, and lintels do not ordinarily carry axial loads, so the worst (and most common) case value for *Vnm* is

$$V_{nm} = 2.25A_n \sqrt{f_m'}$$
 (Equation 20-8)

where  $A_n$  for solidly grouted lintels is simply the lintel width times its height,  $b \times h$ . The design shear is obtained from structural analysis using factored loads and a span measured from center-to-center of bearing. With reference to Figure 20.3, the span would be  $\ell_n$  plus one-half of the bearing length on each end. So if the bearing length is 8 in., as it normally is for CMU construction, then  $\ell = \ell_n + 8$  in. This same span is used to calculate bending moments in the lintel as well. Although some end restraint is provided to the lintel by the masonry surrounding it at the supports, it is customary to design single span lintels as simply supported.

The design shear is permitted to be reduced to that value occurring at a distance d/2 from the face of the support (ACI 530 Section 2.3.6.4). In reinforced concrete design, this corresponding distance is d instead of d/2 and the same limitations apply as for reinforced concrete. The value of  $V_{nm}$  varies along the span for typical lintels, and the term  $M_u/V_ud$  near the supports is usually small where the design shear,  $V_u$ , is large. Therefore, if the designer is willing to make the effort, the value of  $V_{nm}$  from ACI Equation 3-23 can be evaluated at increments along the beam, resulting in a larger value than you get from Equation 20.8.

#### **Cracking Moment**

MSJC 2008 Section 3.3.4.2.2.2 states, "The nominal flexural strength of a beam shall not be less than 1.3 multiplied by the nominal cracking moment of the beam,  $M_{cr}$ . The modulus of rupture,  $f_r$ , for this calculation shall be determined in accordance with ACI 530 Section 3.1.8.2." For solidly grouted rectangular sections,

$$I_g = \frac{bh^3}{12}$$
 and  $M_{cr} = \frac{f_r I_g}{y_t}$  where  $y_t$  is half of the total depth,  $h$ .
$$M_n = A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right)$$
 where  $a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.8 f_m' b}$ 

The nominal moment capacity,  $M_n$ , is determined from the actual bars selected, not the theoretically required value.

#### **Deflections**

The code limits deflections of beams (a lintel is one type of beam) that support unreinforced masonry to  $\ell/600$  under dead plus live unfactored loads (ACI 530 Section 1.13.1.4.1). This limit is waived if the span length does not exceed eight multiplied by the effective depth, d, in the masonry beam. In calculating deflections, the use of an effective moment of inertia, almost identical to that used for deflection calculations of reinforced concrete members,  $I_{eff}$ , is permitted:

$$I_e = \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_a}\right)^3 I_n + \left[1 - \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_a}\right)^3\right] I_{cr} \le I_n$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 1-1)

where  $M_a$  is the maximum moment in the member from the applied loading for which deflection is computed, which is under unfactored dead plus live load.

The cracked, transformed moment of inertia,  $I_{cr}$ , in Equation 1-1 is calculated as follows:

$$I_{cr} = n \left( A_s + \frac{P_u}{f_y} \frac{t_{sp}}{2d} \right) (d - c)^2 + \frac{bc^3}{3}$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-31)

where 
$$c = \frac{A_s f_y + P_u}{0.64 f'_m b}$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-32)

 $t_{sp}$  is the specified wall thickness, and n is the modular ratio defined as the ratio of the elastic modulus of reinforcing steel (29,000,000 psi) divided by the elastic modulus of masonry (900 $f'_m$  from ACI 530 Section 1.8.2.2).

#### Example 20.2

#### Design of Reinforced Concrete Masonry Lintel by Strength Design (ACI 530-11)

The lintel shown in Figure 20.3 has a clear opening of 15 ft 4 in. (horizontal). The opening is 10 ft high and the distance from the bottom of the lintel to the top of the wall is 4 ft. The lintel must carry a uniform live load of 300 plf and a uniform dead load of 320 plf in addition to the masonry's own weight. The wall is constructed of 8-in. thick (nominal) CMU, assume simple supports, and provide a bearing length of 8 in. at each end. The lintel and the masonry above it are fully grouted. Select reinforcing bars. Unit strength = 1900 psi, density = 115 pcf, Type S Masonry Cement mortar, Grade 60 reinforcing steel. The weight of fully grouted masonry is assumed to be 80 psf. (Wall weights are generally given in units of lb/ft<sup>2</sup> of wall surface area.)

#### SOLUTION

The span used in structural calculations is  $\ell = \ell_p$  + bearing length = 15 ft - 4 in. + 8 in. = 16.0 ft. Applying the load factors of ACI 530, which references ASCE 7-10,

$$W_{II} = 1.2W_D + 1.6W_I = 1.2 \times (320 \text{ plf} + 80 \text{ psf} \times 4 \text{ ft}) + 1.6 \times 300 \text{ plf} = 1248 \text{ plf}$$

$$M_n = \frac{w_u l^2}{8} = \frac{1248 \times 16^2}{8} = 39,936 \text{ ft-lb} = 479.2 \text{ in-k}$$

There are many designs that will work. In this design, the authors will look at the shallowest lintel permitted by the maximum reinforcement provisions and work from there. This approach ensures that this limit is not violated, but it may lead to designs with more reinforcement in the lintel than is practical. According to the provisions of ACI 530 Section 3.3.3.5, the strain in the tension steel must be at least  $1.5\epsilon_v$ . Then from Figure 20.2(b), the corresponding value of neutral axis depth permitted,  $c_{max}$ , is given by:

$$c_{\rm max} = \frac{0.0025d}{0.0025 + 1.5\epsilon_{\rm y}} \frac{E_{\rm S}}{E_{\rm S}} = \frac{72.5d}{72.5 + 1.5f_{\rm y}} \quad {\rm for~CMU~construction}$$

For Grade 60 reinforcing,  $c_{\text{max}} = 0.446d$ . Since a = 0.80c,  $a_{\text{max}} = 0.8c_{\text{max}}$ . Using  $a = a_{\text{max}}$  in Equation 20-1,

$$A_{\text{s max}} f_y = 0.80 f'_m a_{\text{max}} b$$

$$\rho_{\text{max}} = \frac{A_{\text{s max}}}{bd} = \frac{0.80 f'_m a_{\text{max}}}{f_v d} = \frac{0.64 f'_m c_{\text{max}}}{f_v d} = \frac{0.64 \times 1.5 \text{ ksi} \times 0.446 d}{60 \text{ ksi} \times d} = 0.00714$$

The preceding equation is limited to members that have rectangular compression zones and a single layer of tension reinforcing. This is the absolute maximum value of  $\rho$  that is permitted, and it is not advisable to use a value this large or even close to this large. Try  $\rho = 0.005$ .

$$bd^2 = \frac{M_u}{\phi f_y \rho \left(1 - \frac{\rho f_y}{1.6 f_m'}\right)} = \frac{479.2 \text{ in-k}}{0.9 \times 60 \text{ ksi} \times 0.005 \left(1 - \frac{0.005 \times 60 \text{ ksi}}{1.6 \times 1.5 \text{ ksi}}\right)} = 1897.4 \text{ in.}^3$$

for 
$$b = 7.625$$
 in.,  $d = 15.77$  in.

select d = 20.625 in. (3 courses).

This assumes that there is a distance of 3 in. from the center of the reinforcing steel to the bottom of the lintel. This distance would include the bottom shell of the CMU (if U-shaped units are used), a  $\frac{1}{2}$ -in. clear space between the reinforcing bar and the bottom shell (ACI 530.1 Section 3.4B.3), and half of the bar diameter. Then from Equation 20-6, and using the value of d = 20.625 in..

$$\rho = \frac{0.80 f'_m}{f_y} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2M_u}{0.80 \phi f'_m b d^2}} \right)$$

$$= \frac{0.80 \times 1.5 \text{ ksi}}{60 \text{ ksi}} \left[ 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2 \times 479.2 \text{ in-k}}{0.80 \times 0.9 \times 1.5 \text{ ksi} \times 7.625 \text{ in.} (20.625 \text{ in.})^2}} \right] = 0.00295$$

$$A_s = \rho bd = 0.00295 \times 7.625 \text{ in.} \times 20.625 \text{ in.} = 0.464 \text{ in.}^2$$

select two #5 bars,  $A_s = 0.62$  in.<sup>2</sup>.

It is not difficult to place two #5 bars within the width provided by an 8-in. wall thickness. The amount of width available is approximately  $7\frac{5}{8}$  in.  $-2 \times 1\frac{1}{4}$  in.  $= 5\frac{1}{8}$  in.

Now compare the capacity,  $\phi V_{nm}$ , to the design shear,  $V_u$ , at a distance d/2 from the face of the support. From Equation 20-8,

$$V_{nm} = 2.25 A_n \sqrt{f_m'} = (2.25 \times 7.625 \text{ in.} \times 23.625 \text{ in.}) \sqrt{1500} \text{ psi} = 15.7 \text{ k}$$

$$V_u = w_u \left(\frac{I_n}{2} - \frac{d}{2}\right) = 1.248 \left(\frac{15.33 \text{ ft} - 20.625 \text{ in.}/12 \text{ in/ft}}{2}\right) = 8.50 \text{ k}$$

$$\phi V_{nm} = 0.8 \times 15.7 \text{ k} = 12.56 \text{ k} > V_u = 8.50 \text{ k} \quad \text{OK}$$

If the amount of steel required had been excessive, or if stirrups had been required for shear, then the depth of the lintel would be increased to four or even more courses.

As a practical matter, there are six courses of masonry above the opening. The top course is grouted to form a bond beam to tie the masonry together. If the bottom three courses are also grouted solid, that leaves two ungrouted courses in the middle. Most designers would simply use all six courses in their calculations. However, using an extremely deep beam may result in having to comply with deep beam provisions in ACI 530 Section 1.13.2. These provisions apply when the effective span is less than three times d for continuous spans. For simple spans, they apply when the effective span is less than two times d. In this case, if all six courses are used, then d=48 in. -3 in. =45 in. and  $3 \times d=135$  in. The effective span is the lesser of the span from center to center of bearing, or 1.15 times the clear span. In this case, the effective span is 184 in., and the deep beam provisions would not apply.

#### **Deflections**

The code limits deflections of beams that support unreinforced masonry to  $\ell/600$  under dead plus live unfactored load, but the limit is waived if the span length does not exceed 8d. In this case,  $8 \times d = (8) (20.625 \text{ in.}) = 165 \text{ in.}$  The span is 16 ft, or 192 in., which exceeds the waiver. Deflections must be computed.

$$I_e = \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_a}\right)^3 I_n + \left[1 - \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_a}\right)^3\right] I_{cr} \le I_n$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 1-1)

where

$$M_{cr} = \frac{f_r I_n}{c} = \frac{120 \text{ psi} \times 8379 \text{ in.}^4}{11.8 \text{ in.}} = 85,116 \text{ in-lb}$$
  
 $f_r = 120 \text{ psi} \text{ (ACI 530 Code Table 3.1.8.2)}$ 

$$I_n = \frac{bh^3}{12} = \frac{(7.625 \text{ in.}) (23.625 \text{ in.})^3}{12} = 8379 \text{ in.}^4$$
  
 $M_a = \frac{w\ell^2}{8} = \frac{(940 \text{ plf}) (16 \text{ ft})^2}{8} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 360,960 \text{ in-lb}$ 

and from ACI 530 Equations 3-31 and 3-32 with  $P_{\mu} = 0$ ,

$$I_{cr} = nA_s(d-c)^2 + \frac{bc^3}{3} = (21.5) (0.62 \text{ in.}^2) (20.625 \text{ in.} - 5.09 \text{ in.})^2 + \frac{(7.625 \text{ in.}) (5.09 \text{ in.})^3}{3} = 3552 \text{ in.}^4$$

where

$$c = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.64 f_c' b} = \frac{(0.62 \text{ in.}^2) (60 \text{ ksi})}{(0.64) (1.5 \text{ ksi}) (7.625 \text{ in.})} = 5.09 \text{ in.}$$

$$n = \frac{E_s}{E_m} = \frac{29,000,000 \text{ psi}}{900 f_m'} = \frac{29,000,000 \text{ psi}}{900 (1500 \text{ psi})} = 21.5$$

$$I_e = \left(\frac{85.1 \text{ in-k}}{361.0 \text{ in-k}}\right)^3 8379 \text{ in.}^4 + \left[1 - \left(\frac{85.1 \text{ in-k}}{361.0 \text{ in-k}}\right)^3\right] 3552 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$= 3615 \text{ in.}^4 < I_n = 8379 \text{ in.}^4$$

$$\Delta = \frac{5w \ell^4}{384EI} = \frac{(5 \times 940 \text{ plf}) (16 \text{ ft})^4}{384 \times 1,350,000 \text{ psi} \times 3615 \text{ in.}^4} \times 1728 \text{ in}^3/\text{ft}^3 = 0.281 \text{ in.} < \frac{\ell}{600}$$

$$= \frac{(16 \text{ ft}) (12 \text{ in/ft})}{600} = 0.327 \text{ in.} \quad \underline{OK}$$

#### **Cracking Moment**

 $M_n$  must exceed 1.3 $M_{cr}$ . From MSJC Code 3.1.8.2, using Type S masonry cement mortar with stress parallel to the bed joints and full grout,  $f_r$  is found to be 120 psi.  $M_n$  is determined from the actual bars selected, not the theoretically required value. Hence, it is based on the area of two #5 bars  $(A_s = 0.62 \text{ in.}^2)$ , not on  $A_s = 0.464 \text{ in.}^2$ .

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.8 f_m' b} = \frac{(0.62 \text{ in.}^2) (60 \text{ ksi})}{(0.8) (1.5 \text{ ksi}) (7.625 \text{ in.})} = 4.07 \text{ in.}$$

$$M_n = A_s f_y \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right) = (0.62 \text{ in.}^2) (60 \text{ ksi}) \left( 20.625 \text{ in.} - \frac{4.07 \text{ in.}}{2} \right) = 691.5 \text{ in-k}$$

Since  $M_n > 1.3M_{cr} = (1.3)$  (85.1 in-k) = 110.6 in-k, the cracking moment provision is satisfied.

#### Walls with Out-of-Plane Loads — Load-Bearing 20.7

Design of load-bearing walls for axial load and bending is very similar to the design of non-load-bearing walls. The effect of axial load must be added to the equations previously developed for non-load-bearing walls. Usually the presence of axial compression adds to the moment capacity of load-bearing walls. If the axial load is eccentric, and it usually is, then the moment is also increased, but usually not by much compared to the lateral load moment.

![](_page_636_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 20.4** One-foot width of load-bearing masonry wall showing masonry stress-block.

However, axial compression also adds to the design moment because of the  $P-\Delta$  effect, so the beneficial effect may be reduced or even nullified.

As with non-load-bearing walls, a 12 in. width of the wall in Figure 20.1 is taken out and shown in Figure 20.4. This figure differs from Figure 20.2 only in that it has an axial load,  $P_n$ , applied at an eccentricity, e, with respect to the center of the wall thickness.

Looking at Figure 20.4(b), the following equations can be developed. First, summing forces axially,  $P_n = C - T$ 

$$P_n = 0.80 f'_m ab - A_s f_v$$
 (Equation 20-9)

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y + P_n}{0.80 f_m' b}$$
 (Equation 20-10)

 $P_n$  is assumed to be positive if compressive. Then, summing moments about the compression force, C.

$$M_n = 0.80 f'_m ab \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right) = (A_s f_y + P_n) \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right)$$
 (Equation 20-11)

These equations are limited to solidly grouted masonry or masonry having a value of  $a \le t_{fs}$ , where  $t_{fs}$  is the face-shell thickness (usually 1.25 in.). The steel is also assumed to be located in the center of the wall. As with non-load-bearing walls,  $M_u \le \phi M_n$ . Therefore,

$$M_u \le \phi M_n = \phi \left( A_s f_y + \frac{P_u}{\phi} \right) \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right)$$
 (Equation 20-12)

An easy way to use this equation is to think of an effective area of tension reinforcing defined as

$$A_{se} = \frac{A_s f_y + (P_u/\phi)}{f_y} = A_s + \frac{P_u}{\phi f_y}$$
 (Equation 20-13)

$$a = \frac{A_{se} f_y}{0.80 f'_{m} b}$$
 (Equation 20-14)

$$M_u = \phi M_n = \phi (A_{se} f_y) \left( d - \frac{a}{2} \right)$$
 (Equation 20-15)

 $A_{se}$  is calculated as though the wall is not axially loaded, then modified for the effect of axial load by  $A_s = A_{se} - P_u/\phi f_y$ . So all of the equations developed for non-load-bearing walls can be used for load-bearing walls, replacing  $A_s$  with  $A_{se}$ . Then, at the end, correct to account for axial load. If a wall is being analyzed instead of designed, simply use  $A_{se}$  in place of  $A_s$  to determine its moment capacity. The moment capacity will vary with the amount of axial load.

#### **Maximum Area of Reinforcement**

The maximum area of reinforcement provisions of ACI 530 Section 3.3.3.5 must include the effects of axial load on ductility. An easy way to do this for load-bearing walls is to calculate  $c_{\text{max}}$  as derived before and be sure that the value of c for your design does not exceed it.

$$c_{\text{max}} = \frac{0.0025d}{0.0025 + 1.5\epsilon_{\text{y}}} \frac{E_{\text{s}}}{E_{\text{s}}} = \frac{72.5d}{72.5 + 1.5f_{\text{y}}}$$
 for CMU construction

Calculate the design value of c from the depth of the stress block, a, using c = a/0.80. However, the value of a should be based on the actual steel area chosen, not the area theoretically required. Be sure to use  $A_{se}$  to calculate a so the effect of axial load is included.

#### Secondary Bending Moments in Walls Loaded Out-of-Plane: The P-δ Effect

The ACI 530 Code (Section 3.3.5) provides an approximate method to account for secondary moments in walls that are loaded both axially and out-of-plane. The lateral load produces deflections that are amplified by the axial load. This effect is accounted for in reinforced concrete columns by the moment magnifier (Chapter 11), but the masonry code uses a different approach called the P- $\delta$  effect. In order to comply with the limitations of the method, the axial load is limited to  $P_u \leq 0.20 f_m' A_\varrho$ . For slender walls having h/t exceeding 30,  $P_u \leq 0.05 f_m' A_\varrho$ (the coefficient reduces from 0.20 to 0.05). The code does not give guidance on how to design walls outside this range, so the authors recommend limiting wall designs to the permitted range. The available research does not include walls outside this range

$$M_u = \frac{w_u h^2}{8} + \frac{P_{uf} e_u}{2} + P_u \delta_u$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-26)

where 
$$P_u = P_{uw} + P_{uf}$$
.

The first two terms of the preceding equation are the moment from lateral load (e.g., wind or earthquake) and the moment at mid-height from eccentric axial load superimposed on the top of the wall from a floor or roof system. The third term is the secondary moment caused by the lateral deflection of the wall being acted upon by the axial load,  $P_u$ . In this case,  $P_u$  is larger than  $P_{uf}$  because it includes the wall weight,  $P_{uw}$ . Note that the wall weight does not cause bending in the wall because it is concentric.

The term  $\delta_u$  in Equation 3-26 is calculated from Equation 3-29 or 3-30. However, the term  $\delta_{ser}$  is replaced with  $\delta_u$  and  $M_{ser}$  with  $M_u$ . In most cases,  $M_u > M_{ser}$  and Equation 3-30 is the only equation that applies.

$$\delta_s = \frac{5M_{cr}h^2}{48E_m I_g} \quad \text{for } M_{cr} \le M_{ser}$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-29)

$$\delta_s = \frac{5M_{cr}h^2}{48E_mI_e} + \frac{5(M_{ser} - M_{cr})h^2}{48E_mI_{cr}} \quad \text{for } M_{cr} \le M_{ser} \le M_u \qquad \text{(ACI 530 Equation 3-30)}$$

In using Code Equation 3-29 or 3-30 in conjunction with Equation 3-26, the calculation of  $\delta_u$  is iterative. The first calculation produces a value of  $\delta_u$  that is then substituted into Code Equation 3-26. This new value of  $M_u$  is then substituted into Code Equation 3-30, and a new, larger value of  $\delta_u$  is obtained. This new value is now substituted into Code Equation 3-26, and a new, larger  $M_u$  is obtained. This process is repeated until successive calculations show little difference indicating convergence. In the event that they do not converge, the wall is not stable, and it must be redesigned. A redesign may involve larger bars, closer bar spacing, a thicker wall, or a larger value of  $f'_m$ .

Some of the terms in Code Equation 3-30 require that the final wall design be known. For example, *Icr* is the cracked moment of inertia, which requires knowing the wall thickness, grout spacing (if partially grouted), and bar size and spacing. The designer must make a very good guess initially or be faced with throwing out the trial design after an iteration or two.

### Example 20.3

#### **Exterior Load-Bearing Wall**

The wall designed in Example 20.1 is now repeated; however, eccentric axial dead and live loads are added. The *eccentricity* of the dead and live loads is 2 in. to the right of the center of the wall. For simplicity, the wall is also specified to be fully grouted. Loads and load combinations from ASCE 7-10 are given in the table below:

<sup>1</sup>Plus wall self-weight at critical section.

*f*<sup>1</sup> = 0.5 since the live load is less than 100 psf, the building is not a garage and is not for public assembly. (ASCE 7-10 Section 2.3.2, exception 1)

The loads *Lr* (roof live), *S* (snow), and *R* (rain) are all zero in this example. Case 4 or case 6 is likely to control the design since the moment is so large. Assume case 4 controls (*Pu* = 1160 lb/ft, *Mu* = 16,712 in-lb/ft) and verify later. However, both cases must be checked.

Try a 6-in, wall, d = 5.625 in, /2 = 2.8125 in.

$$\rho = \frac{0.8f'_m}{f_y} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2M_u}{0.8 \phi f'_m b d^2}} \right)$$

$$= \frac{0.8 \times 1500 \text{ psi}}{60,000 \text{ psi}} \left[ 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2 \times 16,712 \text{ in-lb}}{(0.8 \times 0.9 \times 1500 \text{ psi} \times 12 \text{ in.}) (2.8125 \text{ in.})^2}} \right]$$

$$= 0.00358$$

$$A_s = \rho b d - \frac{P_u}{\phi f_s} = 0.00358 \times 12 \text{ in.} \times 2.8125 \text{ in.} - \frac{1020}{(0.9) (60,000 \text{ psi})} = 0.102 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$$

Try #5 bars at 24 in. ( $A_s = 0.31 \text{ in.}^2 \times 12 \text{ in.}/24 \text{ in.} = 0.155 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft} > 0.102 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$  OK)

MSJC 2011 Code Section 3.3.5.3 requires for h/t > 30 that the axial stress under factored load not exceed  $0.05f_m$ . In this case,  $h/t = 18 \text{ ft} \times 12 \text{ in/ft/6 in.} = 36$ , so the axial stress cannot exceed 0.05 × 1500 psi = 75 psi. The maximum factored axial load is 1468 lb. If wall self-weight is added, based on a partially grouted wall with #5 bars at 24-in. centers, the dead load is increased by the wall height times a wall weight of 37 psf. The value of P<sub>11</sub> using a dead load factor of 1.2 is, therefore,  $P_u = 1468 \text{ lb/ft} + 1.2 \times 18 \text{ ft} \times 37 \text{ psf} = 2267 \text{ lb/ft}$ . The cross-sectional area of a 6-in. wall with full grout is 12 in. × 5.625 in. = 67.5 in<sup>2</sup>/ft (NCMA TEK 14-13B). The stress is  $(2267 \text{ lb/ft})/(67.5 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}) = 33.6 \text{ psi} < 75 \text{ psi}$ . This condition is satisfied. It would probably be OK to use the wall weight at mid-height here, but the authors chose to be conservative. The code provision is unclear on this point.

This is a preliminary design in that the P- $\delta$  moments are not yet included. It has intentionally been somewhat conservative by trying a bar selection with  $A_s = 0.155 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$  when only 0.102 in<sup>2</sup>/ft is needed. A similar design for load case 6 results in  $A_s = 0.105 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$ , which is more than 0.102 in.<sup>2</sup>, hence load case 6 controls without the  $P-\delta$  effect. However, case 4 will have a higher P- $\delta$  term, so it is not possible to tell which is more critical without actually making the  $P-\delta$  calculations. The trial value of  $A_s(0.155 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft})$  exceeds both 0.102 in<sup>2</sup>/ft and  $0.105 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}.$ 

### P- $\delta$ Analysis for Load Case 4 ( $P_{\mu}$ = 1160 lb/ft, $M_{\mu}$ = 16,712 in-lb/ft)

The dead load for load case 4 is increased by self-weight of the wall above the critical section (9 ft  $\times$  37 psf = 333 lb/ft). The new value of  $P_u = 1160$  lb/ft + 1.2  $\times$  333 lb/ft = 1560 plf.

$$n = \frac{29,000}{1350} = 21.5$$

$$c = \frac{A_s f_y + P_u}{0.64 f'_m b} = \frac{(0.155 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}) (60,000 \text{ psi}) + 1560 \text{ lb}}{(0.64) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.})} = 0.943 \text{ in.}$$

$$I_{cr} = \frac{bc^3}{3} + n \left( A_s + \frac{P_u}{f_y} \right) (d - c)^2$$

$$= \frac{(12 \text{ in.}) (0.943 \text{ in.})^3}{3} + (21.48) \left( 0.155 \text{ in.}^2 + \frac{1560 \text{ lb}}{60,000 \text{ psi}} \right) (2.8125 \text{ in.} - 0.943 \text{ in.})^2$$

$$= 16.94 \text{ in}^4/\text{ft}$$

$$I_g = \frac{bt_{sp}^3}{12} = \frac{12 \times 5.625^3}{12} = 178 \text{ in}^4/\text{ft} \quad (\text{NCMA TEK } 14.1B)$$

$$f_r = 153 \text{ psi} \quad (\text{ACI } 530 \text{ Table } 3.1.8.2.1 \text{ for full grout})$$

The value of  $f_r$  can be increased by the axial stress,  $P_u/A_n$ , associated with the load case under consideration because axial compression offsets flexural tension.

$$f_r = 153 \text{ psi} + \frac{1560 \text{ lb}}{(12 \text{ in.}) (5.625 \text{ in.})} = 176.1 \text{ psi}$$
  
 $M_{cr} = \frac{f_r I_g}{y_t} = 176.1 \text{ psi} \times \frac{178 \text{ in.}^4}{2.8125 \text{ in.}} = 11,145 \text{ in-lb/ft}$ 

Since  $M_u > M_{cr}$ , Equation 3-30 controls.

$$\begin{split} \delta_u &= \frac{5M_{cr}h^2}{48E_mI_g} + \frac{5(M_u - M_{cr})h^2}{48E_mI_{cr}} \quad \text{for } M_{cr} \leq M_u \\ \delta_u &= \frac{(5)\,(11,145\,\,\text{in-lb})\,(216\,\,\text{in.})^2}{(48)\,(1,350,000\,\,\text{psi})\,(178\,\,\text{in.}^4)} + \frac{(5)\,(16,712\,\,\text{in-lb} - 11,145\,\,\text{in-lb})\,(216\,\,\text{in.})^2}{(48)\,(1,350,000\,\,\text{psi})\,(16.94\,\,\text{in.}^4)} = 1.408\,\,\text{in.} \\ M_u &= \frac{w_uh^2}{8} + \frac{P_{uf}e}{2} + P_u\delta_u = 16,712 + 1560 \times 1.408 = 18,909\,\,\text{in-lb} \end{split}$$

Repeat the calculation of  $\delta_u$ , using the new value of  $M_u$  (18,909 in-lb instead of 16,712 in-lb). The new value of  $\delta_u$  is 1.875 in. After three iterations, the moment is 19,878 in-lb and  $\delta_u$  is 2.03 in. If carried out to convergence (five or six iterations), the moment is 19,998 in-k/ft and  $\delta_u$  is 2.10 in. These calculations are well suited for spreadsheets.

Now that the design moment, including the secondary moment  $(P-\delta)$  effect), has been determined, the required  $A_s$  to resist this moment at an axial load of 1560 lb must be determined. Equations 20-12 through 20-15 are applicable for this solution since the wall is solidly grouted and the steel is not off-center. An *iterative solution* follows, but the equations can be solved a number of ways, just as we did in Chapter 4.

$$A_s f_y + \frac{P_u}{\phi} = \frac{M_u}{\phi \left[d - (a/2)\right]}$$

Iterate these two equations until a converges.

$$a = \frac{\left[A_s f_y + \left(P_u/\phi\right)\right]}{0.8 f_m' b}$$

Assume a value for a, start with a = 1 in

$$A_s f_y + \frac{P_u}{\phi} = \frac{19,998 \text{ in-lb}}{0.9 \left(2.8125 \text{ in.} - \frac{1 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)} = 9609 \text{ lb}$$
$$a = \frac{9609 \text{ lb}}{(0.8) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.})} = 0.667 \text{ in.}$$

This value of a is closer to the actual value, and it is now used instead of a=1 in.

$$A_s f_y + \frac{P_u}{\phi} = \frac{19,998 \text{ in-lb}}{0.9 \left(2.8125 \text{ in.} - \frac{0.667 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)} = 8964 \text{ lb}$$

$$a = \frac{8964 \text{ lb}}{(0.8) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.})} = 0.622 \text{ in.}$$

Iterating again,

$$A_s f_y + \frac{P_u}{\phi} = \frac{19,998 \text{ in-lb}}{0.9 \left(2.8125 \text{ in.} - \frac{0.622 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)} = 8884 \text{ lb}$$

$$a = \frac{8884 \text{ lb}}{(0.8) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.})} = 0.617 \text{ in.}$$

The last two iterations are close enough to be considered to have converged. So the value of  $A_s$  can be computed based upon the last value,  $A_s f_v + P_u/\phi = 8884$  lb.

$$A_s = \frac{8884 \text{ lb} - (P_u/\phi)}{f_v} = \frac{8884 \text{ lb} - (1560 \text{ lb}/0.9)}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.119 \text{ in.}^2$$

Since this value of  $A_s$  is less than the trial value of 0.155 in.<sup>2</sup>, the *trial value* is sufficient. Note that it does not mean that an  $A_s$  of 0.119 in.<sup>2</sup> is sufficient because the wall deflection properties were based upon the trial value of 0.155 in.<sup>2</sup>, not 0.119 in.<sup>2</sup>.

#### P- $\delta$ Analysis for Load Case 6 ( $P_{ij} = 765 \text{ lb/ft}$ , $M_{ij} = 16,317 \text{ in-lb/ft}$ )

The dead load for load case 6 is also increased by self-weight of the wall above the critical section (9 ft  $\times$  37 psf = 333 lb/ft). The new value of  $P_u = 765$  lb/ft =  $0.9 \times 333$  lb/ft = 1065 plf. The correction for  $f_r$  for axial load is  $f_r = 153 \text{ psi} + 1065 \text{ lb/ft/}(12 \text{ in.}) (5.625 \text{ in.}) =$ 168.8 psi. The corrected value of  $M_{cr} = (168.8 \text{ psi}) (178 \text{ in.}^4)/(2.8125 \text{ in.}) = 10,683 \text{ in-lb/ft.}$ 

Use the same iterative method to find  $\delta_{\mu}$  as was used for case 4, but for an axial load of 1065 lb/ft and moment (before P- $\delta$  is applied) of 16,317 in-lb/ft.

Following all of the tedious steps used for case 4, the final value of  $\delta_u = 1.885$  in. and the moment,  $M_{u}$ , is 18,324 in-lb/ft. Instead of using the iterative method, the direct solution of the quadratic equation (Equation 20-6) is used to find the required  $A_{c}$ , just to demonstrate another technique.

$$\rho = \frac{0.80f'_m}{f_y} \left( 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2M_u}{0.80\phi f'_m b d^2}} \right)$$

$$= \frac{(0.80) (1500 \text{ psi})}{60,000 \text{ psi}} \left[ 1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{2 (18,324 \text{ in-lb})}{0.80(0.90) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.}) (2.8125 \text{ in.})^2}} \right]$$

$$= 0.00397$$

$$A_{se} = \rho b d = (0.00397) (12 \text{ in.}) (2.8125 \text{ in.}) = 0.134 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$$

$$A_s = A_{se} - \frac{P_u}{\phi f_y} = 0.134 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft} - \frac{1065 \text{ lb/ft}}{(0.9) (60,000 \text{ psi})} = 0.114 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$$

Since this area is less than 0.119 in.<sup>2</sup> determined for case 4, case 4 is more critical.

#### Check for Compliance with the Maximum Reinforcing Provisions

The final design of #5 bars at 24 in. on center must now be checked for compliance with ACI 530 Section 3.3.3.5.1. One way to check for this provision is to confirm that the actual value of c is less than  $c_{\text{max}}$ .

$$c_{\text{max}} = \frac{0.0025d}{0.0025 + \mu \epsilon_y} \frac{E_s}{E_s} = \frac{72.5d}{72.5 + \mu f_y} = \frac{72.5d}{72.5 + \mu \times 60} \quad \text{for CMU construction}$$

$$c_{\text{max}} = 0.446d \quad \text{for } \mu = 1.5$$

$$a_{\text{max}} = 0.8c_{\text{max}} = 0.8(0.446) (2.8125 \text{ in.}) = 1.00 \text{ in.}$$

$$a = \frac{A_s f_y + (P_u/\phi)}{0.80f_w' b} = \frac{(0.155 \text{ in.}^2) (60,000) + (1560 \text{ lb/0.9})}{(0.8) (1500 \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.})} = 0.766 \text{ in.} < a_{\text{max}} \quad \underline{OK}$$

The value of a used here (0.766 in.) is the actual value used in the wall, not the theoretical value needed.

This example demonstrates that strength design is not well suited for hand calculations because of the P- $\delta$  effect. A 6-in. nominal thickness wall was chosen here to illustrate the P- $\delta$  calculations on an example with significant deflections. It is not intended to be a recommended design.

Use a 6-in. CMU wall with #5 bars spaced at 24-in. centers, fully grouted.

### 20.8 Walls with In-Plane Loading — Shear Walls

A masonry shear wall is a masonry wall loaded in its own plane. Reinforced concrete shear walls were discussed in Section 18.5 of this text. Refer to that section to understand the source of loads for shear walls. The assumptions used to develop equations for walls loaded out of plane are applied to the geometry of shear walls to obtain equations necessary for their analysis and design. Most shear walls contain multiple layers of reinforcement (e.g., Figure 18.8 in Chapter 18). Each of these layers is subjected to a different strain, hence potentially a different stress. The rectangular stress block used for lintels and walls is also applied to the masonry in compression in shear walls.

Figure 20.5 shows a shear wall subjected to a compressive strain of  $\epsilon_{mu}$  on the right side and a tensile strain of  $\epsilon_{tu}$  on the left. The axial force and bending moment that would cause this strain is calculated in the same way as for reinforced concrete columns in Section 10.3 of this text. Each reinforcing bar has a different strain, hence, potentially a different stress. However, if the strain in any bar is  $\epsilon_y$  or more, the stress is  $f_y$ . If the strain in a bar is compressive, the stress is taken as zero. However, when calculating the maximum flexural tensile reinforcement described in Section 20.4, using the compressive force in reinforcing steel is permitted.

From the strain diagram in Figure 20.5 using similar triangles, the strain at any location in the wall,  $\epsilon_i$ , can be related to  $\epsilon_{mu}$ , c, and the distance to that location from the extreme compressive fiber,  $\epsilon_i$ . For CMU construction,  $\epsilon_{mu} = 0.0025$ .

$$\frac{\epsilon_{mu}}{c} = \frac{\epsilon_{tu}}{d_v - c} = \frac{\epsilon_i}{d_i - c}$$

The stress in each bar is the strain in that bar,  $\epsilon_i$ , multiplied by  $E_s$ , but not more than  $f_v$ .

$$T_i = A_{si}f_{si} = A_{si}\epsilon_i E_s = A_{si}\frac{\epsilon_{mu}(d_i - c)}{c}E_s \le A_{si}f_y$$

The compressive force in the masonry is determined from the compressive stress block,

$$C = 0.80 f'_m a t_{sp} = 0.80 f'_m (0.80c) t_{sp} = 0.64 f'_m c t_{sp}$$

![](_page_642_Figure_14.jpeg)

FIGURE 20.5 Shear wall strain and stress.

The axial force through the centroid of the wall,  $P_{\mu}$ , is determined from summing axial forces:

$$P_n = C - \sum T_i = 0.64 f'_m c t_{sp} - \sum A_{si} f_{si}$$

The in-plane moment in the wall is obtained by summing moments of the individual tension forces in the steel bars and the moment of the compression force with respect to the center of the wall.

$$M_n = C\frac{d_v - a}{2} + \sum T_i \left( d_i - \frac{d_v}{2} \right)$$

The coordinates of  $P_n$ ,  $M_n$  pairs for any assumed value of neutral axis depth, c, can then be plotted to form an interaction diagram. This is the same process used for developing the interaction diagram for reinforced concrete columns in Chapter 10.

#### Example 20.4

Develop the interaction diagram for a shear wall that has the following properties:

$$d_v =$$
 24 ft 8 in. = 296 in., height =  $h =$  14 ft 0 in.,  $t_{sp} =$  7.625 in., #5 bars at 48 in. centers  $t_m' =$  1500 psi,  $t_v =$  60 ksi

#### SOLUTION

This wall will have seven bars, equally spaced, with the first bar at 4 in. from each end. Hence, according to the notation in Figure 20.5,

$$d_1 = d_v - 4$$
 in. = 296 in.  $-4$  in. = 292 in.  $d_2 = d_1 - 48$  in. = 292 in.  $-48$  in. = 244 in.  $d_3 = 196$  in.,  $d_4 = 148$  in.,  $d_5 = 100$  in.,  $d_6 = 52$  in.,  $d_7 = 4$  in.

Assume c = 146 in.

Then 
$$a=0.8(146 \text{ in.})=116.8 \text{ in.}$$

$$C=0.64f'_mct_{sp}=0.64(1500 \text{ psi}) (146 \text{ in.}) (7.625 \text{ in.})$$

$$=1,068,720 \text{ lb}=1069 \text{ k}$$

$$\frac{\epsilon_i}{d_i-c}=\frac{\epsilon_{mu}}{c}, \qquad \epsilon_1=\frac{(d_1-c)\epsilon_{mu}}{c}=\frac{(292-146) (0.0025)}{146}=0.0025>\epsilon_y$$

$$\therefore f_{s1}=f_y=60 \text{ ksi}$$

$$\epsilon_2=\frac{(d_2-c)\epsilon_{mu}}{c}=\frac{(244-146) (0.0025)}{146}=0.001678<\epsilon_y$$

$$\therefore f_{s2}=\epsilon_2 E_s=(0.001678) (29,000 \text{ ksi})=48.66 \text{ ksi}$$

$$\epsilon_3=\frac{(d_3-c)\epsilon_{mu}}{c}=\frac{(196-146) (0.0025)}{146}=0.00086<\epsilon_y$$

$$\therefore f_{s2}=\epsilon_3 E_s=(0.00086) (29,000 \text{ ksi})=24.83 \text{ ksi}$$

$$\epsilon_4=\frac{(d_4-c)\epsilon_{mu}}{c}=\frac{(148-146) (0.0025)}{146}=0.000034<\epsilon_y$$

$$\therefore f_{s2}=\epsilon_4 E_s=(0.000034) (29,000 \text{ ksi})=0.99 \text{ ksi}$$

The remaining bars are in compression, and therefore their contribution to the forces in the section must be neglected. The tension force in each bar is  $T_i = A_{si} f_{si}$ . Since all of the bars are

the same size (they usually are in a shear wall),  $A_{si}$  is constant for all bars, and the equations are simplified as follows:

$$\begin{split} P_n &= C - \sum T_i = 0.64 f_m' c t_{sp} - A_{si} \sum f_{si} \\ &= (0.64) \, (1.500 \text{ ksi}) \, (146 \text{ in.}) \, (7.625 \text{ in.}) - (0.31 \text{ in.}^2) \, (60 \text{ k} + 48.66 \text{ k} + 24.83 \text{ k} + 0.99 \text{ k}) \\ &= 1027 \text{ k} \\ \phi P_n &= 0.9 \, (1027 \text{ k}) = 924 \text{ k} \\ M_n &= C \frac{d_v - a}{2} + \sum T_i \left( d_i - \frac{d_v}{2} \right) = C \frac{d_v - a}{2} + A_{si} \sum f_{si} \left( d_i - \frac{d_v}{2} \right) \\ &= (1069 \text{ k}) \frac{296 \text{ in.} - 116.8 \text{ in.}}{2} \\ &+ (0.31) \left[ \begin{array}{c} (60 \text{ ksi}) \left( 292 \text{ in.} - \frac{296}{2} \text{ in.} \right) + (48.66 \text{ ksi}) \left( 244 \text{ in.} - \frac{296}{2} \text{ in.} \right) \\ &+ (24.83 \text{ ksi}) \left( 196 \text{ in.} - \frac{296}{2} \text{ in.} \right) + (0.99 \text{ ksi}) \left( 148 \text{ in.} - \frac{296}{2} \text{ in.} \right) \end{array} \right] \\ &= 100,253 \text{ in-k} = 8354 \text{ ft-k} \\ \phi M_n &= 0.9 (8354 \text{ ft-k}) = 7519 \text{ ft-k} \end{split}$$

The coordinates of one point of the interaction diagram  $\phi P_n$ ,  $\phi M_n$  are (924 k, 7521 ft-k). This single point is shown in Table 20.3, along with numerous other points. The points are calculated from assumed values of  $c/d_1$  that give a wide range of values for this parameter. Also included is the axial load associated with ACI 530 Code Equations 3-18 and 3-19. This is the horizontal line shown at a value of 1232 k. This value is the only one that depends on the slenderness reduction factor. The value of  $\phi P_{n \text{ max}}$  associated with the maximum permitted reinforcement provision is also included in the table. It is obtained using  $c = c_{\text{max}}$  and, in this case, is based

on a ductility factor of  $\mu=4$  (special reinforced shear wall). Note that in calculating  $\rho P_{n\max}$ the compression force in the reinforcing steel was included, unlike in all other cases. The pure tension case ( $P_n = A_s f_y$ ,  $M_n = 0$ ), is also included to complete the diagram.

FIGURE 20.6 Interaction diagram for reinforced masonry shear wall for Example 20.4.

The coordinates of the last two columns from Table 20.3 are plotted in Figure 20.6.

Just as with reinforced concrete columns, all sets of values of  $P_{\mu}$  and  $M_{\mu}$  associated with the load combinations given in Chapter 4 must fall within the diagram. For example, if a shear wall has  $M_u = 6000$  ft-k, the axial load must fall within the range  $550 \,\mathrm{k} < P_u < 1750 \,\mathrm{k}$ . However, the maximum axial load from Equation 3-18 is 1252 k, so this value would control instead of 1750 k. These limits are approximate in that they were simply read from the graph.

#### **Shear Capacity of Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls**

Shear design of reinforced masonry shear walls by strength design is very similar to that of reinforced concrete shear walls covered Section 18.6 of this text.

The masonry shear capacity is given by ACI 530 Equation 3-23 in ACI Section 3.3.4.1.2,

$$V_{nm} = \left[4.0 - 1.75 \left(\frac{M_u}{V_u d}\right)\right] A_n \sqrt{f_m'} + 0.25 P_u$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-23)

The value of  $M_u/V_u d_v$  is often less than unity, but not be taken greater than unit. The friction term,  $0.25f_m$ , recognizes that axial compression increases shear capacity from frictional effects. The coefficient of 0.25 implies a coefficient of friction of 0.25. In shear walls, the masonry alone often cannot resist the design shear force,  $V_u$ . Additional shear capacity can be provided by shear reinforcement in the form of reinforcing bars in horizontal bond beams. By using units with webs that are not full height, a horizontal space is provided for placement of horizontal bars. Often two bars are placed in a bond beam, but not always.

The combined capacity of the masonry and the shear reinforcement is given by

$$V_n = V_{nm} + V_{ns}$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-20)

Upper limits are placed on  $V_n$  by

(a) Where  $M_u/V_u d_v \le 0.25$ :

$$V_n \le 6A_{nv}f_m'$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-21)

**(b)** Where  $M_u/V_u d_v > 1.0$ 

$$V_{n} < 4A_{nn}f'_{nn}$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-22)

(c) The maximum value of  $V_n$  for  $M_u/V_u d_v$  between 0.25 and 1.0 can be obtained from linear interpolation between the two equations.

![](_page_646_Figure_2.jpeg)

Finally, the shear capacity provided by shear reinforcement placed at a spacing, s, having an area of steel,  $A_v$ , is

$$V_{ns} = 0.5 \frac{A_v f_y d_v}{s}$$
 (ACI 530 Equation 3-24)

where  $f_y$  is the specified yield strength for the shear reinforcing. For example, if one #5 bar is placed in a single-bond beam,  $A_v = (1) (0.31 \text{ in.}^2) = 0.31 \text{ in.}^2$ .

The maximum spacing between shear reinforcing is the lesser of  $d_{\nu}/2$  or 48 in. This provision is in ACI 530 Code Section 3.3.4.2.3, which applies only to beams. However, the authors feel they should apply also to shear walls. Also, the end of the shear reinforcement bars should be hooked around the longitudinal (vertical) reinforcement.

#### **Design of Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls**

Design of reinforced masonry shear walls involves the same issues that we found when designing columns. There are just too many variables to solve the equations in a closed form. A graphical technique or spreadsheet (or other computer software) is needed to design for combined axial load and bending moment. There is not enough room in this single chapter on masonry to develop these. A simple spreadsheet is provided for this chapter to assist in the design process. Design for shear can be done by hand by applying the equations in ACI Code Section 3.3.4.1.2.

#### Example 20.5

Design the shear wall below for shear

$$d_{\rm v}=288$$
 in.,  $t_{\rm sp}=7.625$  in.,  $h=192$  in.,  $t_{\rm m}'=1500$  psi,  $t_{\rm y}=60$  ksi  $P_{\rm u}=86$  k,  $M_{\rm u}=33,880$  in-k,  $V_{\rm u}=280$  k

#### SOLUTION

$$\begin{split} \frac{M_u}{V_u d_v} &= \frac{33,880 \text{ in-k}}{280 \text{ k} \times 288 \text{ in.}} = 0.42 < 1 \\ V_{nm} &= \left(4 - 1.75 \frac{M_u}{V_u d}\right) \sqrt{f_m'} A_n + 0.25 P_u \\ &= [4 - 1.75(0.42)] \sqrt{1500} \text{ psi} \times 7.625 \text{ in.} \times 288 \text{ in.} + 0.25(86,000 \text{ lb}) = 299,170 \text{ k} \\ V_u &= 28 \text{ k} > \phi V_m = 0.80 \times 299.17 \text{ k} = 239.3 \text{ k} & \text{Shear reinforcement is required.} \\ V_{ns} &= \frac{V_u}{\phi_{\text{shear}}} - V_{nm} = \frac{280 \text{ k}}{0.8} - 299.17 \text{ k} = 50.83 \text{ k} \\ \frac{A_v}{s} &= \frac{V_{ns}}{0.5 f_v d_v} = \frac{50.83 \text{ k}}{(0.5) (60 \text{ ksi}) (288 \text{ in.})} = 0.00588 \text{ in.} \end{split}$$

If bond beams are provided in every third course, s = 24 in. Then  $A_v \ge (0.00588 \text{ in.})(24 \text{ in.}) =$ 0.141 in.<sup>2</sup>. If bond beams are spaced at 48 in., then  $A_{\nu} \ge (0.00588 \text{ in.}) (48 \text{ in.}) = 0.282 \text{ in.}^2$ . Use two #4 bars in horizontal bond beams at s = 48 in. (vertical spacing). The actual value of  $A_{\rm v}/{\rm s} = 2(0.20 \text{ in.}^2)/48 \text{ in.} = 0.00833 \text{ in.}$ 

ACI 530 Code 3.3.6.2 requires that reinforcement having an area at least equal to onethird A., be provided perpendicular to the shear reinforcement. This vertical reinforcement must be uniformly distributed and shall not exceed a spacing of 8 ft. This provision is met by providing  $A_s/s = 0.00833$  in./3 = 0.00278 in. If a horizontal spacing of 48 in. is chosen, then the area of steel required is  $(0.00278 \text{ in.})(48 \text{ in.}) = 0.133 \text{ in.}^2$ . This is satisfied by using a #4 bar  $(A_s = 0.20 \text{ in.}^2)$ . Design for combined flexure and axial load may require more vertical steel than this, however.

Summary of shear design: Use two #4 bars in horizontal bond beams at a vertical spacing of 48 in. Use at least one #4 bar vertically at a 48-in. horizontal spacing.

#### 20.9 Computer Example

#### Example 20.6

Using the Excel spreadsheets provided for Chapter 20, design a reinforced masonry shear wall (intermediate reinforced shear wall) for the following three load and moment combinations,

- **1.**  $P_{ij} = 500 \text{ k}$  and  $M_{ij} = 4500 \text{ ft-k}$
- **2.**  $P_{ij} = 1000 \text{ k}$  and  $M_{ij} = 5000 \text{ ft-k}$
- **3.**  $P_u = 250 \text{ k}$  and  $M_u = 3500 \text{ ft-k}$

The wall is 248 in. long and 144 in. tall. The material properties are the same as those in Example 20.5.

#### SOLUTION

Open the spreadsheet called Shearwall. Enter values in all cells highlighted in yellow (only in the Excel spreadsheets, not the printed example). Since the wall is shorter than the one in the spreadsheet, the number and/or location of bars must be modified. Since the bar spacing in the original spreadsheet is 48 in., it would be a simple matter to simply drop off one of the bars (the one farthest from the extreme compressive fiber). Just change the value of  $A_{\rm s1}$  from the value shown to zero (cell C27), and the bar has been deleted. Enter a trial wall thickness (try 7.625 in. in cell B10) and bar area (try 0.31 in.2 in cell C21). Enter the load combinations in the Loads Table (cells I9 through N11). Now select the Interaction Diagram tab, and observe if all of the loads

(plotted as an X, a square, and a triangle) fall within the diagram. The X does not. Try increasing the bar size from 0.31 in.<sup>2</sup> to 0.44 in.<sup>2</sup>. Now they all fit. The value of  $P_{n\,\text{max}}$  is shown to be 385 k, which must exceed the load combination of  $D+0.75L+0.525Q_E$ .
