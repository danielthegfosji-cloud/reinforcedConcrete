# **CHA PTER 15** Torsion

### **15.1 Introduction**

The average designer probably does not worry about torsion very much. He or she thinks almost exclusively of axial forces, shears, and bending moments, and yet most reinforced concrete structures are subject to some degree of torsion. Until recent years, the safety factors required by codes for the design of reinforced concrete members for shear, moment, and so forth were so large that the effects of torsion could be safely neglected in all but the most extreme cases. Today, however, overall safety factors are less than they used to be and members are smaller, with the result that torsion is a more common problem.

Appreciable torsion does occur in many structures, such as in the main girders of bridges, which are twisted by transverse beams or slabs. It occurs in buildings where the edge of a floor slab and its beams are supported by a spandrel beam running between the exterior columns. This situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1, where the floor beams tend to twist the spandrel beam laterally. Earthquakes can cause dangerous torsional forces in all buildings. This is particularly true in asymmetrical structures, where the centers of mass and rigidity do not coincide. Other cases where torsion may be significant are in curved bridge girders, spiral stairways, and balcony girders, and whenever large loads are applied to any beam "off center." An off-center case where torsional stress can be very large is illustrated in Figure 15.2. It should be realized that if the supporting member is able to rotate, the resulting torsional stresses will be fairly small. If, however, the member is restrained, the torsional stresses can be quite large.

Should a plain concrete member be subjected to pure torsion, it will crack and fail along 45◦ spiral lines because of the diagonal tension corresponding to the torsional stresses. For a very effective demonstration of this type of failure, you can take a piece of chalk in your hands and twist it until it breaks. Although the diagonal tension stresses produced by twisting are very similar to those caused by shear, they will occur on all faces of a member. As a result, they add to the stresses caused by shear on one side and subtract from them on the other.1

Recently, there have been more reports of structural failures attributed to torsion. As a result, a rather large amount of research has been devoted to the subject, and thus there is a much-improved understanding of the behavior of structural members subjected to torsion. On the basis of this rather extensive experimental work, the ACI Code includes very specific requirements for the design of reinforced concrete members subjected to torsion or to torsion combined with shear and bending. It should be realized that maximum shears and torsional forces may occur in areas where bending moments are small. For such cases, the interaction of shear and torsion can be particularly important as it relates to design.

### **15.2 Torsional Reinforcing**

Reinforced concrete members subjected to large torsional forces may fail quite suddenly if they are not specially provided with torsional reinforcing. The addition of torsional reinforcing does not change the magnitude of the torsion that will cause diagonal tension cracks, but it does prevent the members from tearing apart. As a result, they will be able to resist substantial torsional moments without failure. Tests have shown that both longitudinal bars and closed stirrups (or spirals) are necessary to intercept the numerous diagonal tension cracks that occur on all surfaces of members subject to appreciable torsional forces.

The normal -shaped stirrups are not satisfactory. They must be closed either by welding their ends together to form a continuous loop, as illustrated in Figure 15.3(a), or by bending their ends around a longitudinal bar, as shown in part (b) of the same figure. If one-piece stirrups such as these are used, the entire beam cage may have to be prefabricated and placed as a unit (and that may not be feasible if the longitudinal bars have to be passed between column bars) or the longitudinal bars will have to be threaded one by one through the closed stirrups and perhaps the column bars. It is easy to see that some other arrangement is usually desirable.

**FI GU RE 15.4** Overlaping stirrups used as torsion reinforcing *but not desirable*.

In the recent past, it was rather common to use two overlapping stirrups arranged as shown in Figure 15.4. Although this arrangement simplifies the placement of longitudinal bars, it has not proved very satisfactory. As described in the ACI Commentary (R11.5.4.1), members primarily subjected to torsion lose their concrete side cover by spalling at high torques. Should this happen, the lapped spliced stirrups of Figure 15.4 will prove ineffective, and premature torsion failure may occur.

A much better type of torsion reinforcement consists of stirrups, each with a properly anchored top bar, such as the ones shown in Figure 15.5. It has been proved by testing that the use of torsional stirrups with 90◦ hooks results in spalling of the concrete outside the hooks. The use of 135◦ hooks for both the stirrups and the top bars is very helpful in reducing this spalling.

Should lateral confinement of the stirrups be provided as shown in parts (b) and (c) of Figure 15.5, the 90◦ hooks will be satisfactory for the top bars.

Should beams with wide webs (say, 2 ft or more) be used, it is common to use multipleleg stirrups. For such situations, the outer stirrup legs will be proportioned for both shear and torsion, while the interior legs will be designed to take only vertical shear.

**FI GU RE 15.5** Recommended torsion reinforcement.

The strength of closed stirrups cannot be developed unless additional longitudinal reinforcing is supplied. Longitudinal bars should be spaced uniformly around the insides of the stirrups, not more than 12 in. apart. There must be at least one bar in each corner of the stirrups to provide anchorage for the stirrup legs (Code 11.6.6.2); otherwise, if the concrete inside the corners were to be crushed, the stirrups would slip and the result would be even larger torsional cracks. These longitudinal bars must have diameters at least equal to 0.042 times the stirrup spacing. Their size may not be less than #3.

### **15.3 Torsional Moments that Have to Be Considered in Design**

The reader is well aware from his or her studies of structural analysis that if one part of a statically indeterminate structure "gives" when a particular force is applied to that part, the amount of force that the part will have to resist will be appreciably reduced. For instance, if three men are walking along with a log on their shoulders (a statically indeterminate situation) and one of them lowers his shoulder a little under the load, there will be a major redistribution of the internal forces in the "structure" and a great deal less load for him to support. On the other hand, if two men are walking along with a log on their shoulders (a statically determinate situation) and one of them lowers his shoulder slightly, there will be little change in force distribution in the structure. These are similar to the situations that occur in statically determinate and indeterminate structures subject to torsional moments. They are referred to respectively as *equilibrium torsion* and *compatibility torsion*.

- **1.** *Equilibrium torsion*—For a statically determinate structure, there is only one path along which a torsional moment can be transmitted to the supports. This type of torsional moment, which is referred to as *equilibrium torsion* or *statically determinate torsion*, cannot be reduced by a redistribution of internal forces or by a rotation of the member. Equilibrium torsion is illustrated in Figure 15.6, which shows an edge beam supporting a concrete canopy. The edge beam must be designed to resist the full calculated torsional moment.
- **2.** *Compatibility torsion*—The torsional moment in a particular part of a statically indeterminate structure may be substantially reduced if that part of the structure cracks under the torsion and "gives," or rotates. The result will be a redistribution of forces in the structure. This type of torsion, which is illustrated in Figure 15.7, is referred to as *statically indeterminate torsion* or *compatibility torsion*, in the sense that the part of the structure in question twists in order to keep the deformations of the structure compatible.

FIGURE 15.7 Compatibility torsion.

Where a reduction or redistribution of torsion is possible in a statically indeterminate structure, the maximum factored moment,  $T_u$ , can be reduced as follows for nonprestressed members according to ACI Section 11.5.2.2. In the expression to follow,  $A_{cp}$  is the area enclosed by the outside perimeter of the concrete cross section and  $p_{cp}$  is the outside perimeter of that cross section. It is assumed that torsional cracking will occur when the principal tension stress reaches the tensile strength of the concrete in biaxial tension-compression. This cracking value is taken to be  $4\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}$ , and thus the torque at cracking,  $T_{cr}$ , is

$$T_{cr} = \phi 4\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} \left( \frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}} \right)$$

When reinforced concrete members are subjected to axial tensile or compressive forces,  $T_{cr}$  is to be computed with the expression to follow in which  $N_u$  is the factored axial force taken as positive if the force is compressive and negative if it is tensile.

$$T_{cr} = \phi 4\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} \left(\frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}}\right) \lambda \sqrt{1 + \frac{N_u}{4\sqrt{f_c'}}}$$

After cracking occurs, the torsional moments in the spandrel beam shown in Figure 15.7 are reduced as a result of the redistribution of the internal forces. Consequently, the torsional moment used for design in the spandrel beam can be reduced.

#### 15.4 Torsional Stresses

As previously mentioned, the torsional stresses add to the shear stresses on one side of a member and subtract from them on the other. This situation is illustrated for a hollow beam in Figure 15.8.

Torsional stresses are quite low near the center of a solid beam. Because of this, hollow beams (assuming the wall thicknesses meet certain ACI requirements) are assumed to have almost exactly the same torsional strengths as solid beams with the same outside dimensions.

In solid sections, the shear stresses due to the torsion,  $T_u$ , are concentrated in an outside "tube" of the member, a shown in Figure 15.9(a), while the shear stresses resulting from  $V_u$  are spread across the width of the solid section, as shown in part (b) of the figure. As a result, the two types of shear stresses (those from shear and torsion) are combined, using a square root expression shown in the next section of this chapter.

![](_page_495_Figure_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 15.9 Torsion and shear stresses in a solid beam.

![](_page_495_Picture_6.jpeg)

FIGURE 15.10 Imaginary space truss.

After cracking, the resistance of concrete to torsion is assumed to be negligible. The torsion cracks tend to spiral around members (hollow or solid) located at approximately 45° angles with the longitudinal edges of those members. Torsion is assumed to be resisted by an imaginary space truss located in the outer "tube" of concrete of the member. Such a truss is shown in Figure 15.10. The longitudinal steel in the corners of the member and the closed transverse stirrups act as tension members in the "truss," while the diagonal concrete between the stirrups acts as struts of compression members. The cracked concrete is still capable of taking compression stresses.

### When Torsional Reinforcing Is Required by the ACI

The design of reinforced concrete members for torsion is based on a thin-walled tube space truss analogy in which the inside or core concrete of the members is neglected. After torsion has caused a member to crack, its resistance to torsion is provided almost entirely by the closed stirrups and the longitudinal reinforcing located near the member surface. Once cracking occurs, the concrete is assumed to have negligible torsional strength left. (This is not the case in shear design, where the concrete is assumed to carry the same amount of shear as it did before cracking.)

If torsional stresses are less than about one-fourth of the cracking torque,  $T_{cr}$ , of a member, they will not appreciably reduce either its shear or flexural strengths. Torsional cracking is assumed to occur when the principal tensile stress reaches  $4\lambda\sqrt{f_c}$ . In ACI Section 11.6.1, it is stated that torsion effects may be neglected for nonprestressed members if

$$T_u < \phi \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} \left( \frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}} \right) = \frac{1}{4} T_{cr}$$

![](_page_496_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 15.11** Portions of monolithic T beam that may be used for torsion calculations.

For statically indeterminate structures where reductions in torsional moments can occur because of redistribution of internal forces, Section 11.6.2.2 of the ACI Code permits the maximum factored torsional moment to be reduced to the following value:

$$\phi 4\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} \left( \frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}} \right)$$

In other words, the applied torque may be limited to a member's calculated cracking moment. (If the computed torque for a particular member is larger than the preceding value, the preceding value may be used in design.) Should the torsional moments be reduced as described here, it will be necessary to redistribute these moments to adjoining members. The ACI Commentary (R11.5.2.1 and R11.5.2.2) does say that when the layout of structures is such as to impose significant torsional rotations within a short length of a member (as where a large torque is located near a stiff column), a more exact analysis should be used.

For isolated members with or without flanges,  $A_{cp}$  equals the area of the entire cross sections (including the area of any voids in hollow members), and  $p_{cp}$  represents the perimeters of the entire cross sections. Should a beam be cast monolithically with a slab, the values of  $A_{cp}$  and  $p_{cp}$  may be assumed to include part of the adjacent slabs of the resulting T- or L-shaped sections. The widths of the slabs that may be included as parts of the beams are described in ACI Section 13.2.4 and illustrated in Figure 15.11. Those widths or extensions may not exceed the projections of the beams above or below the slab or four times the slab thickness, whichever is smaller.

When appreciable torsion is present, it may be more economical to select a larger beam than would normally be selected so that torsion reinforcing does not have to be used. Such a beam may very well be more economical than a smaller one with the closed stirrups and additional longitudinal steel required for torsion design. On other occasions, such a practice may not be economical, and sometimes architectural considerations may dictate the use of smaller sections.

### 15.6 Torsional Moment Strength

The sizes of members subject to shear and torsion are limited by the ACI Code so that unsightly cracking is reduced and crushing of the surface concrete caused by inclined compression stresses is prevented. This objective is accomplished with the equations that follow, in which the left-hand portions represent the shear stresses from shear and torsion. The sum of these two stresses in a particular member may not exceed the stress that will cause shear cracking  $(8\sqrt{f_c'})$  as per ACI R11.6.3). In these expressions,  $V_c = 2\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}b_wd$  (ACI Equation 11-3). For solid sections

$$\sqrt{\left(\frac{V_u}{b_w d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{T_u p_h}{1.7A_{oh}^2}\right)^2} \le \phi \left(\frac{V_c}{b_w d} + 8\sqrt{f_c'}\right)$$
 (ACI Equation 11-18)

For hollow sections

$$\left(\frac{V_u}{b_w d}\right) + \left(\frac{T_u p_h}{1.7A_{ch}^2}\right) \le \phi \left(\frac{V_c}{b_w d} + 8\sqrt{f_c'}\right)$$
 (ACI Equation 11-19)

Should the wall thickness of a hollow section be less than  $A_{oh}/p_h$ , the second term in ACI Equation 11-19 is to be taken not as  $T_u p_h / 1.7 A_{oh}^2$  but as  $T_u / 1.7 A_{oh}$ , where t is the thickness of the wall where stresses are being checked (ACI 11.5.3.3).

Another requirement given in ACI Section 11.5.4.4 for hollow sections is that the distance from the centerline of the transverse torsion reinforcing to the inside face of the wall must not be less than  $0.5A_{oh}/p_h$ . In this expression,  $p_h$  is the perimeter of the centerline of the outermost closed torsional reinforcing, while  $A_{oh}$  is the cross-sectional area of the member that is enclosed within this centerline. The letters oh stand for outside hoop (of stirrups).

#### **Design of Torsional Reinforcing** 15.7

The torsional strength of reinforced concrete beams can be greatly increased by adding torsional reinforcing consisting of closed stirrups and longitudinal bars. If the factored torsional moment for a particular member is larger than the value given in ACI Section 11.5.1  $\left[\phi\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}\left(A_{cp}^2/P_h\right)\right]$ , the code provides an expression to compute the absolute minimum area of transverse closed stirrups that may be used.

$$(A_v + 2A_t) = 0.75\sqrt{f_c'} \frac{b_w s}{f_{vt}} \ge \frac{50b_w s}{f_{vt}}$$
 (ACI Equation 11-23)

In this expression,  $A_{\nu}$  is the area of reinforcing required for shear in a distance s (which represents the stirrup spacing). You will remember from shear design that the area  $A_n$  obtained is for both legs of a two-legged stirrup (or for all legs of a four-legged stirrup, etc.). The value A<sub>t</sub>, which represents the area of the stirrups needed for torsion, is for only one leg of the stirrup. Therefore, the value  $A_v + 2A_t$  is the total area of both legs of the stirrup (for twolegged stirrups) needed for shear plus torsion. It is considered desirable to use equal volumes of steel in the stirrups and the added longitudinal steel so that they will participate equally in resisting torsional moments. This theory was followed in preparing the ACI equations used for selecting torsional reinforcing. The ACI Code requires that the area of stirrups  $A_t$  used for resisting torsion be computed with the equation that follows:

$$T_n = \frac{2A_o A_t f_{yt}}{s} \cot \theta \qquad (ACI \text{ Equation } 11-21)$$

This equation is usually written in the following form:

$$\frac{A_t}{s} = \frac{T_n}{2A_o f_{vt} \cot \theta}$$

The transverse reinforcing is based on the torsional moment strength,  $T_n$ , which equals  $T_u/\phi$ . The term  $A_o$  represents the gross area enclosed by the shear flow path around the perimeter of the tube. This area is defined in terms of  $A_{oh}$ , which is the area enclosed by the outermost closed hoops. Figure 15.12 illustrates this definition of  $A_{oh}$  for several beam cross sections.

The value of  $A_o$  may be determined by analysis, or it may be taken as  $0.85A_{oh}$ . The term  $\theta$  represents the angle of the concrete "compression diagonals" in the analogous space truss. It

![](_page_497_Figure_13.jpeg)

**FIGURE 15.12** Values of  $A_{oh}$ .

may not be smaller than  $30^{\circ}$  or larger than  $60^{\circ}$ , and it may be taken equal to  $45^{\circ}$ , according to ACI Section 11.5.3.6. In ACI Section 11.5.3.6, the value of  $\theta$  may be  $45^{\circ}$  for nonprestressed members, and that practice is followed herein. Suggested  $\theta$  values for prestressed concrete are given in this same ACI section.

As given in the ACI Commentary (R11.5.3.8), the required stirrup areas for shear and torsion are added together as follows for a two-legged stirrup:

$$Total\left(\frac{A_{v+t}}{s}\right) = \frac{A_v}{s} + \frac{2A_t}{s}$$

The spacing of transverse torsional reinforcing may not be larger than  $p_h/8$  or 12 in., where  $p_h$  is the perimeter of the centerline of the outermost closed transverse reinforcing (ACI 11.5.6.1). Remember also the maximum spacings of stirrups for shear d/2 and d/4 given in ACI Sections 11.4.5.1 and 11.4.5.3.

It has been found that reinforced concrete specimens with less than about 1% torsional reinforcing by volume that are loaded in pure torsion fail as soon as torsional cracking occurs. The percentage is smaller for members subject to both torsion and shear. The equation to follow, which provides a minimum total area of longitudinal torsional reinforcing, is based on using about 0.5% torsional reinforcing by volume. In this expression,  $A_{cp}$  is the area enclosed by the outside concrete cross section. The value  $A_t/s$  may not be taken as less than  $25b_w/f_{yv}$ , according to ACI Section 11.5.5.3.

$$A_{\ell \text{ min}} = \frac{5\sqrt{f_c'}A_{cp}}{f_v} - \left(\frac{A_t}{s}\right)p_h \frac{f_{yt}}{f_v}$$
 (ACI Equation 11-24)

ACI Section 11.5.4.3 states the longitudinal torsion reinforcement must be developed at both ends.

Maximum torsion generally acts at the ends of beams, and as a result the longitudinal torsion bars should be anchored for their yield strength at the face of the supports. To do this, it may be necessary to use hooks or horizontal  $\sqcup$ -shaped bars lap spliced with the longitudinal torsion reinforcing. A rather common practice is to extend the bottom reinforcing in spandrel beams subjected to torsion 6 in. into the supports. Usually this is insufficient.

### 15.8 Additional ACI Requirements

Before we present numerical examples for torsion design, it is necessary to list several other ACI requirements. These are:

- 1. Sections located at a distance less than d from the face of support may be designed for the torque at a distance d. Should, however, a concentrated torque be present within this distance, the critical design section will be at the face of the support (ACI 11.5.2.4).
- **2.** The design yield strength of torsion reinforcing for nonprestressed members may not be greater than 60,000 psi. The purpose of this maximum value is to limit the width of diagonal cracks (ACI 11.5.3.4).
- 3. The longitudinal tension created by torsion moments is partly offset in the flexural compression zones of members. In these zones, the computed area of longitudinal torsional reinforcing may be reduced by an amount equal to  $M_u/0.9df_y$ , according to ACI Section 11.5.3.9. In this expression,  $M_u$  is the factored moment acting at the section in combination with  $T_u$ . The reinforcing provided, however, may not be less than the minimum values required in ACI Sections 11.5.5.3 and 11.5.6.2.
- **4.** The longitudinal reinforcing must be distributed around the inside perimeter of the closed stirrups and must be spaced no farther apart than 12 in. At least one bar must be placed in each corner of the stirrups to provide anchorage for the stirrup legs. These bars have

- to be #3 or larger in size, and they must have diameters no less than 0.042 times the stirrup spacings (ACI 11.5.6.2).
- 5. Torsional reinforcing must be provided for a distance no less than  $b_t + d$  beyond the point where it is theoretically no longer required. The term  $b_t$  represents the width of that part of the member cross section which contains the closed torsional stirrups (ACI 11.5.6.3).

#### 15.9 **Example Problems Using U.S. Customary Units**

In this section, the design of torsional reinforcing for a beam is presented using U.S. customary units; an example using SI units is presented in the next section.

#### Example 15.1

Design the torsional reinforcing needed for the beam shown in Figure 15.13 if  $f_c' = 4000$  psi,  $f_v = 60,000 \,\mathrm{psi}, \ T_u = 30 \,\mathrm{ft-k}, \ \mathrm{and} \ V_u = 60 \,\mathrm{k}.$  Assume 1.5-in. clear cover, #4 stirrups, and a required  $A_s$  for  $M_{ii}$  of 3.52 in.<sup>2</sup>. Select #8 bars for flexural reinforcing. Normal-weight concrete is specified.

#### SOLUTION

#### 1. Is Torsion Reinforcing Needed?

 $A_{cp}$  = area enclosed by outside perimeter of concrete cross section = (16) (26) = 416 in.<sup>2</sup> (the letter c stands for concrete, and the letter p stands for perimeter of cross section)

$$p_{cp}$$
 = outside perimeter of the cross section  
= (2) (16 in. + 26 in.) = 84 in.

Torsion,  $T_{ij}$ , can be neglected if less than

$$\phi \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} \frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}} = (0.75)(1.0)(\sqrt{4000} \text{ psi}) \left[ \frac{(416 \text{ in.}^2)^2}{84 \text{ in.}} \right]$$
$$= 97,723 \text{ in-lb} = 97.72 \text{ in-k} < 30 \text{ ft-k} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 360 \text{ in-k}$$

... Torsion must be considered

Note  $x_1$  and  $y_1$  run from c.g. of stirrup on one edge to c.g. of stirrup on other edge.

#### 2. Compute Sectional Properties

 $A_{ob}$  = area enclosed by centerline of the outermost closed stirrups

Noting 1.5-in. clear cover and #4 stirrups

$$x_1 = 16 \text{ in.} - (2) (1.5 \text{ in.} + 0.25 \text{ in.}) = 12.5 \text{ in.}$$
 $y_1 = 26 \text{ in.} - (2) (1.5 \text{ in.} + 0.25 \text{ in.}) = 22.5 \text{ in.}$ 

See Figure 15.13

 $A_{oh} = (12.5 \text{ in.}) (22.5 \text{ in.}) = 281.25 \text{ in.}^2$ 
 $A_o = \text{gross area enclosed by shear flow path}$ 
 $= 0.85A_{oh} \text{ (from ACI Section 11.5.3.6)}$ 
 $= (0.85) (281.25 \text{ in.}^2) = 239.06 \text{ in.}^2$ 
 $d = \text{effective depth of beam}$ 
 $= 26 \text{ in.} - 1.50 \text{ in.} - 0.50 \text{ in.} - \frac{1.00 \text{ in.}}{2} = 23.50 \text{ in.}$ 
 $p_h = \text{perimeter of centerline of outermost closed torsional reinforcing}$ 
 $= (2) (x_1 + y_1)$ 
 $= (2) (12.5 \text{ in.} + 22.5 \text{ in.}) = 70 \text{ in.}$ 

#### 3. Is the Concrete Section Sufficiently Large to Support the Torsion?

$$V_c$$
 = nominal shear strength of concrete section =  $2\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}b_wd$  = (2) (1.0) ( $\sqrt{4000}$  psi) (16 in.) (23.50 in.) = 47,561 lb

Applying ACI Equation 11-18

$$\sqrt{\left(\frac{V_u}{b_w d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{T_u p_h}{1.7 A_{oh}^2}\right)^2} \leq \phi \left(\frac{V_c}{b_w d} + 8 \sqrt{f_c'}\right)$$

$$\sqrt{\left(\frac{60,000 \text{ lb}}{16 \text{ in.} \times 23.50 \text{ in.}}\right)^2 + \left[\frac{360,000 \text{ in-lb} \times 70 \text{ in.}}{1.7 \times (281.25 \text{ in.}^2)^2}\right]^2} \leq 0.75 \left(\frac{47,561 \text{ lb}}{16 \text{ in.} \times 23.50 \text{ in.}} + 8 \sqrt{4000} \text{ psi}\right)$$

$$246 \text{ psi} < 474 \text{ psi}$$

.: Section is sufficiently large

#### 4. Determine the Transverse Torsional Reinforcing Required

$$T_n = \frac{T_u}{\phi} = \frac{30 \text{ ft-k}}{0.75} = 40 \text{ ft-k} = 480,000 \text{ in-lb}$$

Assuming  $\theta = 45^{\circ}$  as per ACI Section 11.5.3.6(a)

$$\frac{A_t}{s} = \frac{T_n}{2A_o f_{yt} \cot \theta} = \frac{480,000 \text{ in-lb}}{(2) (239.06 \text{ in.}^2) (60,000 \text{ psi}) (\cot 45^\circ)}$$
$$= 0.0167 \text{ in.}^2/\text{in. for one leg of stirrups}$$

#### 5. Calculate the Area of Shear Reinforcing Required

$$V_u = 60,000 \text{ lb} > \frac{1}{2} \phi V_c = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (0.75) (47,561 \text{ lb}) = 17,835 \text{ lb}$$

$$V_{\rm s} = \frac{V_u - \phi V_{\rm c}}{\phi} = \frac{60,000 \text{ lb} - (0.75)(1.0)(47,561 \text{ lb})}{0.75} = 32,439 \text{ lb}$$

Applying ACI Equation 11-15

$$\frac{A_v}{s} = \frac{V_s}{f_{yt}d} = \frac{32,439 \text{ lb}}{(60,000 \text{ psi}) (23.50 \text{ in.})}$$

#### 6. Select Stirrups

Total web reinforcing required for two legs =  $\frac{A_{v+t}}{2}$  $=\frac{2A_t}{s}+\frac{A_v}{s}=(2)(0.0167 \text{ in.}^2/\text{in.})+0.0230 \text{ in.}^2/\text{in.}$  $= 0.0564 \, \text{in.}^2/\text{in.}$  for two legs

Using #4 stirrups

$$s = \frac{(2)(0.20 \text{ in.}^2)}{0.0564 \text{ in.}^2/\text{in.}} = 7.09 \text{ in. o.c.}$$

Maximum allowable spacing of stirrups

Minimum area of stirrups  $A_{\nu}$  by ACI Equation 11-23

$$A_v + 2A_t = 0.75\sqrt{f_c'} \frac{b_w s}{f_{yt}} < \frac{50b_w s}{f_{yt}} = \frac{(50) (16 \text{ in.}) (7 \text{ in.})}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.0933 \text{ in.}$$

$$= 0.75\sqrt{4000} \frac{(16 \text{ in.}) (7 \text{ in.})}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.089 \text{ in.}^2$$

$$< (2) (0.20 \text{ in.}^2) = 0.40 \text{ in.}^2 \qquad \underline{OK}$$

#### 7. Selection of Longitudinal Torsion Reinforcing

Additional longitudinal reinforcing required for torsion

$$A_{\ell} = \frac{A_{t}}{s} p_{h} \left( \frac{f_{yt}}{f_{y}} \right) \cot^{2}\theta \qquad (\text{ACI Equation } 11\text{-}22)$$

$$= (0.0167 \text{ in.}^{2}/\text{in.}) (70 \text{ in.}) \left( \frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{60,000 \text{ psi}} \right) (1.00)^{2} = 1.17 \text{ in.}^{2}$$

$$\text{Min. } A_{\ell} = \frac{5\sqrt{f_{c}'}A_{cp}}{f_{y}} - \left( \frac{A_{t}}{s} \right) p_{h} \frac{f_{yt}}{f_{y}} \qquad (\text{ACI Equation } 11\text{-}24)$$

$$\left[ \text{with min } \frac{A_{t}}{s} = \frac{25b_{w}}{f_{yv}} = \frac{(25) (16 \text{ in.})}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.00667 \text{ in.}^{2}/\text{in.} \right]$$

$$= \frac{(5\sqrt{4000} \text{ psi}) (416 \text{ in.}^{2})}{60,000 \text{ psi}} - (0.0167 \text{ in.}^{2}/\text{in.}) (70 \text{ in.}) \left( \frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{60,000 \text{ psi}} \right)$$

$$= 1.02 \text{ in.}^{2} < 1.17 \text{ in.}^{2} \quad \underline{OK}$$

**FIGURE 15.14** Reinforcing selected for beam of Example 15.1.

This additional longitudinal steel is spread out into three layers to the four inside corners of the stirrups and vertically in between, with a spacing not in excess of 12 in.

Assume one-third in top =  $1.17 \text{ in.}^2/3 = 0.39 \text{ in.}^2$ ,  $0.39 \text{ in.}^2 + 3.52 \text{ in.}^2 = 3.91 \text{ in.}^2$  in bottom, and remainder  $0.39 \text{ in.}^2$  in between.

Use two #4 bars (0.40 in.<sup>2</sup>) in top corner, two #4 bars in the middle, and five #8 bars (3.93 in.<sup>2</sup>) at the bottom, as shown in Figure 15.14.

### 15.10 SI Equations and Example Problem

The SI equations necessary for the design of reinforced concrete members that are different from those needed for similar designs using U.S. customary units are listed here, and their use is illustrated in Example 15.2.

Torsional moments can be neglected if

$$T_u = \frac{\phi(0.083)\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}}{12} \frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}}$$
 (ACI Section 11.5.1[a])  
 $V_c = 0.17\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}b_wd$  (ACI Equation 11-3)

Maximum torsional moment strength for solid sections

$$\sqrt{\left(\frac{V_u}{b_w d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{T_u p_h}{1.7A_{oh}^2}\right)^2} \le \phi \left(\frac{V_c}{b_w d} + 0.66\sqrt{f_c'}\right)$$
 (ACI Equation 11-18)

Maximum torsional moment strength for hollow sections

$$\frac{V_u}{b_w d} + \frac{T_u p_h}{1.7A_{oh}^2} \le \phi \left( \frac{V_c}{b_w d} + 0.66\sqrt{f_c'} \right)$$
 (ACI Equation 11-19)

The expression used to calculate the required area of torsional reinforcing needed for one leg of stirrups

$$T_n = \frac{2A_o A_t f_{yt}}{s} \cot \theta \qquad (ACI \text{ Equation } 11-21)$$

from which

$$\frac{A_t}{s} = \frac{T_n}{2A_o f_{vv} \cot \theta}$$

Minimum area of transverse reinforcing required

$$A_v + 2A_t = 0.062\sqrt{f_c'} \frac{b_w s}{f_{yt}}$$

$$\geq \frac{0.35b_w s}{f_{yt}}$$
(ACI Equation 11-23)

Additional longitudinal reinforcing required for torsion

$$A_{\ell} = \frac{A_t}{s} p_h \left( \frac{f_{yt}}{f_y} \right) \cot^2 \theta$$
 (ACI Equation 11-22)

Minimum total area of additional longitudinal reinforcing required

$$A_{\ell \text{ min}} = \frac{0.42\sqrt{f_c'}A_{cp}}{f_v} - \frac{A_t}{s}p_h \frac{f_{yt}}{f_v}$$
 (ACI Equation 11-24)

In this last expression, the value of  $(A_t/s)$  may not be taken as less than  $(b_w/6f_{vv})$ . Other SI requirements for design of torsional reinforcing are:

- 1. Max spacing permitted for transverse torsional reinforcing =  $\frac{1}{8}p_h$  or 300 mm or d/2 or d/4 as required for shear design (ACI 11.5.6.1 and 11.4.4).
- 2. The diameter of stirrups may not be less than 0.042 times their spacing, and stirrups smaller than #10 may not be used (ACI Section 11.5.6.2).
- **3.** Maximum yield stresses  $f_v$  or  $f_{vt} = 420$  MPa (ACI Section 11.5.3.4).

Example 15.2 illustrates the design of the torsional reinforcing for a member using SI units.

#### Example 15.2

Design the torsional reinforcing for the beam shown in Figure 15.15, for which  $f'_c = 28$  MPa,  $f_{\rm V}=$  420 MPa,  $V_{\rm U}=$  190 kN,  $T_{\rm U}=$  30 kN-m, and  $A_{\rm S}$  required for  $M_{\rm U}$  is 2050 mm $^2$ . Assume #13 stirrups and a clear cover equal to 40 mm.

![](_page_503_Figure_15.jpeg)

**FIGURE 15.15** Beam cross section for Example 15.2.

#### SOLUTION

#### 1. Is Torsion Reinforcing Necessary?

$$A_{cp} = (350 \text{ mm}) (650 \text{ mm}) = 227 500 \text{ mm}^2$$

$$p_{cp} = (2) (350 \text{ mm} + 650 \text{ mm}) = 2000 \text{ mm}$$

$$\phi(0.083\lambda)\sqrt{f_c'} \frac{A_{cp}^2}{p_{cp}} = \frac{(0.75) (0.083) (1)\sqrt{28} \text{ MPa}}{12} \frac{(227 500 \text{ mm}^2)^2}{2000 \text{ mm}}$$

$$= 8.558 \times 10^6 \text{ N·mm} = 8.56 \text{ kN·m} < 30 \text{ kN·m}$$
[ACI 11:5:1(a)]

... Torsion reinforcing is required

#### 2. Compute Sectional Properties

With 40-mm clear cover and #13 stirrups (diameter = 12.7 mm)

$$x_1 = 350 \text{ mm} - (2) \left( 40 \text{ mm} + \frac{12.7 \text{ mm}}{2} \right) = 257.3 \text{ mm}$$

$$y_1 = 650 \text{ mm} - (2) \left( 40 \text{ mm} + \frac{12.7 \text{ mm}}{2} \right) = 557.3 \text{ mm}$$

$$A_{oh} = (257.3 \text{ mm}) (557.3 \text{ mm}) = 143 393 \text{ mm}^2$$

$$A_o = 0.85A_{oh} = (0.85) (143 393 \text{ mm}^2) = 121 884 \text{ mm}^2$$

Assuming bottom reinforcing consists of #25 bars (diameter = 25.4 mm)

$$d = 650 \text{ mm} - 40 \text{ mm} - 12.7 \text{ mm} - \frac{25.4 \text{ mm}}{2} = 584.6 \text{ mm}$$
  
 $p_h = 2(x_1 + y_1) = (2)(257.3 \text{ mm} + 557.3 \text{ mm}) = 1629 \text{ mm}$ 

#### 3. Is the Concrete Section Sufficiently Large to Support $T_{\mu}$ ?

$$\begin{split} V_c &= 0.17 \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_w d = (0.17) \, (1.0) \sqrt{28} \, \text{MPa} \, (350 \, \text{mm}) \, (584.6 \, \text{mm}) = 180 \, 449 \, \text{N} \\ &= 180.45 \, \text{kN} \end{split} \tag{ACI Equation 11-3} \\ &\sqrt{\left(\frac{V_u}{b_w d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{T_u p_h}{1.7 A_{ch}^2 b}\right)^2} \leq \phi \left(\frac{V_c}{b_w d} + 0.66 \sqrt{f_c'}\right) \tag{ACI Equation 11-18} \end{split}$$

$$\sqrt{\left(\frac{190 \text{ kN} \times 10^3}{350 \text{ mm} \times 584.6 \text{ mm}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{30 \text{ kN-m} \times 10^6 \times 1629 \text{ mm}}{1.7 \left(143 \text{ } 393 \text{ mm}^2\right)^2}\right)^2} < 0.75 \left(\frac{180.45 \text{ kN} \times 10^3}{350 \text{ mm} \times 584.6 \text{ mm}} + 0.66 \sqrt{28} \text{ Mpa}\right)^2 + 0.66 \sqrt{28} \text{ Mpa}$$

.: Section is sufficiently large

#### 4. Determine the Transverse Torsional Reinforcing Required

$$T_n = \frac{T_u}{\phi} = \frac{30 \text{ kN} \cdot \text{m}}{0.75} = 40 \text{ kN} \cdot \text{m}$$

Assuming  $\theta = 45^{\circ}$  as per ACI 11.5.3.6(a)

$$\frac{A_t}{s} = \frac{T_n}{2A_o f_{yt} \cot \theta} = \frac{40 \text{ kN} \cdot \text{m} \times 10^6}{(2) (121 \text{ 884 mm}^2) (420 \text{ MPa}) (1.0)}$$

$$= 0.391 \text{ mm}^2/\text{mm} \text{ for one leg of stirrup}$$
(ACI Equation 11-21)

#### 5. Calculate the Area of Shear Reinforcing Required

$$V_u = 190 \text{ kN} > \frac{1}{2}V_c = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(180.45 \text{ kN}) = 90.22 \text{ kN}$$

Shear reinforcing is required

$$V_{\rm s} = \frac{V_u - \phi V_{\rm c}}{\phi} = \frac{190 \text{ kN} - (0.75)(180.45 \text{ kN})}{0.75} = 72.88 \text{ kN}$$

$$\frac{A_v}{s} = \frac{V_s}{f_v d} = \frac{72.88 \text{ kN} \times 10^3}{(420 \text{ MPa})(584.6 \text{ mm})} = 0.297 \text{ mm}^2/\text{mm} \text{ for two legs of stirrup}$$

#### 6. Select Stirrups

$$\frac{2A_t}{s} + \frac{A_v}{s} = (2)(0.391 \text{ mm}^2) + 0.297 \text{ mm}^2 = 1.079 \text{ mm}^2/\text{mm}$$
 for two legs of stirrup

Using #13 stirrup ( $A_s = 129 \text{ mm}^2$ )

$$s = \frac{(2)(129 \text{ mm}^2)}{1.079 \text{ mm}^2/\text{mm}} = 239 \text{ mm}$$

Maximum allowable spacing of stirrup

$$=\frac{p_h}{8} = \frac{1629 \text{ mm}}{8} = 204 \text{ mm}$$
 Use 200 mm

Minimum area of stirrup

$$\begin{split} A_v + 2A_t &= 0.062\sqrt{28} \text{ MPa} \frac{\text{(350 mm) (200 mm)}}{420 \text{ MPa}} = 55.11 \text{ mm}^2 \\ &\leq 0.35 \frac{b_w s}{f_y} = 0.35 \frac{\text{(350 mm) (200 mm)}}{420 \text{ MPa}} \qquad \text{(ACI Equation 11-23)} \\ &= 55.56 \text{ mm}^2 < \text{(2) (129 mm}^2\text{)} = 258 \text{ mm}^2 \qquad \underline{\text{OK}} \end{split}$$

### 7. Selection of Longitudinal Torsion Reinforcing

$$A_{\ell} = \frac{A_{t}}{s} \rho_{h} \frac{f_{yt}}{f_{y}} \cot^{2} \theta = (0.391 \text{ mm}^{2}/\text{mm}) (1629 \text{ mm}) \left(\frac{420 \text{ MPa}}{420 \text{ MPa}}\right) (1.0)^{2}$$

$$= 637 \text{ mm}^{2} \qquad (ACI \text{ Equation } 11-22)$$

Additional longitudinal steel is spread out to the four inside corners of the stirrups and vertically in between. Assume one-third in top =  $557 \text{ mm}^2/3 = 186 \text{ mm}^2$ ,  $186 \text{ mm}^2 +$ 2050 mm<sup>2</sup> = 2236 mm<sup>2</sup> in bottom, and remainder 186 mm<sup>2</sup> in between.

Use two #13 bars (258 mm<sup>2</sup>) in top corners and at middepth and five #25 (2550 mm<sup>2</sup>) in bottom.
