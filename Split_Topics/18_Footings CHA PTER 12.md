# Footings **CHA PTER 12**

### **12.1 Introduction**

Footings are structural members used to support columns and walls and transmit their loads to the underlying soils. Reinforced concrete is a material admirably suited for footings and is used as such for both reinforced concrete and structural steel buildings, bridges, towers, and other structures.

The permissible pressure on a soil beneath a footing is normally a few tons per square foot. The compressive stresses in the walls and columns of an ordinary structure may run as high as a few hundred tons per square foot. It is, therefore, necessary to spread these loads over sufficient soil areas to permit the soil to support the loads safely.

Not only is it desired to transfer the superstructure loads to the soil beneath in a manner that will prevent excessive or uneven settlements and rotations, but it is also necessary to provide sufficient resistance to sliding and overturning.

To accomplish these objectives, it is necessary to transmit the supported loads to a soil of sufficient strength and then to spread them out over an area such that the unit pressure is within a reasonable range. If it is not possible to dig a short distance and find a satisfactory soil, it will be necessary to use piles or caissons to do the job. These latter subjects are not considered within the scope of this text.

The closer a foundation is to the ground surface, the more economical it will be to construct. There are two reasons, however, that may keep the designer from using very shallow foundations. First, it is necessary to locate the bottom of a footing below the ground freezing level to avoid vertical movement or heaving of the footing as the soil freezes and expands in volume. This depth varies from about 3 ft to 6 ft in the northern states and less in the southern states. Second, it is necessary to excavate a sufficient distance so that a satisfactory bearing material is reached, and this distance may on occasion be quite a few feet.

### **12.2 Types of Footings**

Among the several types of reinforced concrete footings in common use are the wall, isolated, combined, raft, and pile-cap types. These are briefly introduced in this section; the remainder of the chapter is used to provide more detailed information about the simpler types of this group.

- **1.** A *wall footing*, as shown in Figure 12.1(a), is simply an enlargement of the bottom of a wall that will sufficiently distribute the load to the foundation soil. Wall footings are normally used around the perimeter of a building and perhaps for some of the interior walls.
- **2.** An *isolated or single-column footing*, as shown in Figure 12.1(b), is used to support the load of a single column. These are the most commonly used footings, particularly where the loads are relatively light and the columns are not closely spaced.

- **3.** *Combined footings* are used to support two or more column loads, Figure 12.1(c). A combined footing might be economical where two or more heavily loaded columns are so spaced that normally designed single-column footings would run into each other. Single-column footings are usually square or rectangular and, when used for columns located right at property lines, extend across those lines. A footing for such a column combined with one for an interior column can be designed to fit within the property lines.
- **4.** A *mat or raft or floating foundation*, Figure 12.1(d), is a continuous reinforced concrete slab over a large area used to support many columns and walls. This kind of foundation is used where soil strength is low or where column loads are large but where piles or caissons are not used. For such cases, isolated footings would be so large that it is more economical to use a continuous raft or mat under the entire area. The cost of the formwork for a mat footing is far less than is the cost of the forms for a large number of isolated footings. If individual footings are designed for each column and if their combined area is greater than half of the area contained within the perimeter of the building, it is usually more economical to use one large footing or mat. The raft or mat foundation is particularly useful in reducing differential settlements between columns—the reduction being 50% or more. For these types of footings, the excavations are often rather deep. The goal is to remove an amount of earth approximately equal to the building weight. If this is done, the net soil pressure after the building is constructed will theoretically equal what it was before the excavation was made. Thus, the building will *float* on the raft foundation.
- **5.** *Pile caps*, Figure 12.1(e), are slabs of reinforced concrete used to distribute column loads to groups of piles.

### **12.3 Actual Soil Pressures**

The soil pressure at the surface of contact between a footing and the soil is assumed to be uniformly distributed as long as the load above is applied at the center of gravity of the footing, Figure 12.2(a). This assumption is made even though many tests have shown that soil pressures are unevenly distributed due to variations in soil properties, footing rigidity, and other factors.

As an example of the variation of soil pressures, footings on sand and clay soils are considered. When footings are supported by sandy soils, the pressures are larger under the center of the footing and smaller near the edge, Figure 12.2(b). The sand at the edges of the footing does not have a great deal of lateral support and tends to move from underneath the footing edges, with the result that more of the load is carried near the center of the footing. Should the bottom of a footing be located at some distance from the ground surface, a sandy soil will provide fairly uniform support because it is restrained from lateral movement.

![](_page_369_Figure_5.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 12.2** Soil conditions.

Just the opposite situation is true for footings supported by clayey soils. The clay under the edges of the footing sticks to or has cohesion with the surrounding clay soil. As a result, more of the load is carried at the edge of the footing than near the middle [see Figure 12.2(c)].

The designer should clearly understand that the assumption of uniform soil pressure underneath footings is made for reasons of simplifying calculations and may very well have to be revised for some soil conditions.

Should the load be eccentrically applied to a footing with respect to the center of gravity of the footing, the soil pressure is assumed to vary uniformly in proportion to the moment, as illustrated in Section 12.12 and Figure 12.23.

### **12.4 Allowable Soil Pressures**

The allowable soil pressures to be used for designing the footings for a particular structure are preferably obtained by using the services of a geotechnical engineer. He or she will determine safe values from the principles of soil mechanics on the basis of test borings, load tests, and other experimental investigations. Other issues may enter into the determination of the allowable soil pressures, such as the sensitivity of the building frame to deflection of the footings. Also, cracking of the superstructure resulting from settlement of the footings would be much more important in a performing arts center than a warehouse.

Because such investigations often may not be feasible, most building codes provide certain approximate allowable bearing pressures that can be used for the types of soils and soil conditions occurring in that locality. Table 12.1 shows a set of allowable values that are typical of such building codes. It is thought that these values usually provide factors of safety of approximately three against severe settlements.

Section 15.2.2 of the ACI Code states that the required area of a footing is to be determined by dividing the anticipated total load, including the footing weight, by a permissible soil pressure or permissible pile capacity determined using the principles of soil mechanics. It will be noted that this total load is the *unfactored* load, and yet the design of footings described in this chapter is based on strength design, where the loads are multiplied by the appropriate load

factors. It is obvious that an ultimate load cannot be divided by an allowable soil pressure to determine the bearing area required.

The designer can handle this problem in two ways. He or she can determine the bearing area required by summing up the actual or unfactored dead and live loads and dividing them by the allowable soil pressure. Once this area is determined and the dimensions are selected, an ultimate soil pressure can be computed by dividing the factored or ultimate load by the area provided. The remainder of the footing can then be designed by the strength method using this ultimate soil pressure. This simple procedure is used for the footing examples here.

The 1971 ACI Commentary (15.2) provided an alternative method for determining the footing area required that will give exactly the same answers as the procedure just described. By this latter method, the allowable soil pressure is increased to an ultimate value by multiplying it by a ratio equal to that used for increasing the magnitude of the service loads. For instance, the ratio for *D* and *L* loads would be

$$Ratio = \frac{1.2D + 1.6L}{D + L}$$

Or for *D* + *L* + *W* , and so on

Ratio = 
$$\frac{1.2D + 1.6W + 1.0L + 0.5(L_r \text{ or } S \text{ or } R)}{D + L + W + (L_r \text{ or } S \text{ or } R)}$$

The resulting ultimate soil pressure can be divided into the ultimate column load to determine the area required.

### **12.5 Design of Wall Footings**

The theory used for designing beams is applicable to the design of footings with only a few modifications. The upward soil pressure under the wall footing of Figure 12.3 tends to bend the footing into the deformed shape shown. The footings will be designed as shallow beams for the moments and shears involved. In beams where loads are usually only a few hundred pounds per foot and spans are fairly large, sizes are almost always proportioned for moment. In footings, loads from the supporting soils may run several thousand pounds per foot and spans are relatively short. As a result, shears will almost always control depths.

It appears that the maximum moment in this footing occurs under the middle of the wall, but tests have shown that this is not correct because of the rigidity of such walls. If the walls are of reinforced concrete with their considerable rigidity, it is considered satisfactory to compute the moments at the faces of the walls (ACI Code 15.4.2). Should a footing be supporting a masonry wall with its greater flexibility, the code states that the moment should be taken at a section halfway from the face of the wall to its center. (For a column with a steel base plate, the critical section for moment is to be located halfway from the face of the column to the edge of the plate.)

To compute the bending moments and shears in a footing, it is necessary to compute only the net upward pressure, *qu* , caused by the factored wall loads above. In other words, the weight of the footing and soil on top of the footing can be neglected. These items cause an upward pressure equal to their downward weights, and they cancel each other for purposes of computing shears and moments. In a similar manner, it is obvious that there are no moments or shears existing in a book lying flat on a table.

Should a wall footing be loaded until it fails in shear, the failure will not occur on a vertical plane at the wall face but rather at an angle of approximately 45◦ with the wall, as shown in Figure 12.4. Apparently the diagonal tension, which one would expect to cause cracks in between the two diagonal lines, is opposed by the squeezing or compression caused by the

![](_page_372_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12.3** Shear and moment diagram for wall footing with uniform soil pressure.

downward wall load and the upward soil pressure. Outside this zone, the compression effect is negligible in its effect on diagonal tension. Therefore, for nonprestressed sections, shear may be calculated at a distance d from the face of the wall (ACI Code 11.1.3.1) because of the loads located outside the section.

The use of stirrups in footings is usually considered impractical and uneconomical. For this reason, the effective depth of wall footings is selected so that  $V_u$  is limited to the design shear strength,  $\phi V_c$ , that the concrete can carry without web reinforcing, that is,  $\phi 2\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_w d$  (from ACI Section 11.3.1.1 and ACI Equation 11-3). Although the equation for  $V_c$  contains the term  $\lambda$ , it would be unusual to use lightweight concrete to construct a footing. The primary advantage for using lightweight concrete and its associated additional cost is to reduce the weight of the concrete superstructure. It would not be economical to use it in a footing.

![](_page_372_Figure_6.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12.4** Critical section for shear in a wall footing.

For this reason, the term  $\lambda$  will not be included in the example problems for this chapter. The following expression is used to select the depths of wall footings:

$$d = \frac{V_u}{\left(\phi\right)\left(2\lambda\sqrt{f_c'}\right)\left(b_w\right)}$$

or for SI units

$$d = \frac{3V_u}{\phi \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_w}$$

The design of wall footings is conveniently handled by using 12-in. widths of the wall, as shown in Figure 12.5. Such a practice is followed for the design of a wall footing in Example 12.1. It should be noted that Section 15.7 of the code states that the depth of a footing above the bottom reinforcing bars may be no less than 6 in. for footings on soils and 12 in, for those on piles. Thus, total minimum practical depths are at least 10 in, for regular spread footings and 16 in. for pile caps.

In SI units, it is convenient to design wall footings for 1-m-wide sections of the walls. The depth of such footings above the bottom reinforcing may not be less than 150 mm for footings on soils or 300 mm for those on piles. As a result, minimum footing depths are at least 250 mm for regular spread footings and 400 mm for pile caps.

The design of a wall footing is illustrated in Example 12.1. Although the example problems and homework problems of this chapter use various  $f'_c$  values, 3000 psi and 4000 psi concretes are commonly used for footings and are generally quite economical. Occasionally, when it is very important to minimize footing depths and weights, stronger concretes may be used. For most cases, however, the extra cost of higher-strength concrete will appreciably exceed the money saved with the smaller concrete volume. The exposure category of the footing may control the concrete strength. ACI Section 4.2 requires that concrete exposed to sulfate have minimum  $f_c'$  values of 4000 psi or 4500 psi, depending on the sulfur concentration

The determination of a footing depth is a trial-and-error problem. The designer assumes an effective depth, d, computes the d required for shear, tries another d, computes the d required for shear, and so on, until the assumed value and the calculated value are within about 1 in. of each other.

FIGURE 12.5 One-foot design strip width for wall footing.

You probably get upset when a footing size is assumed here. You say, "Where in the world did you get that value?" We think of what seems like a reasonable footing size and start there. We compute the *d* required for shear and probably find we've missed the assumed value quite a bit. We then try another value roughly two-thirds to three-fourths of the way from the trial value to the computed value (for wall footings) and compute *d*. (For column footings, we probably go about halfway from the trial value to the computed value.) Two trials are usually sufficient. We have the advantage over you in that often in preparing the sample problems for this textbook, we made some scratch-paper trials before arriving at the assumed values used.

#### Example 12.1

Design a wall footing to support a 12-in.-wide reinforced concrete wall with a dead load D=20 k/ft and a live load L=15 k/ft. The bottom of the footing is to be 4 ft below the final grade, the soil weighs 100 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>, the allowable soil pressure,  $q_a$ , is 4 ksf, and there is no appreciable sulfur content in the soil.  $f_v=60$  ksi and  $f_c'=3$  ksi, normal-weight concrete.

#### SOLUTION

Assume a 12-in.-thick footing (d=8.5 in.). The cover is determined by referring to the code (7.7.1), which says that for concrete cast against and permanently exposed to the earth, a minimum of 3 in. clear distance outside any reinforcing is required. In severe exposure conditions, such as high sulfate concentration in the soil, the cover must be suitably increased (ACI Code Section 7.7.6).

The footing weight is (12 in./12 in/ft)(150 pcf) = 150 psf, and the soil fill on top of the footing is (36 in./12 in/ft)(100 pcf) = 300 psf. So 450 psf of the allowable soil pressure  $q_a$  is used to support the footing itself and the soil fill on top. The remaining soil pressure is available to support the wall loads. It is called  $q_e$ , the effective soil pressure

$$q_{\rm e} = 4000 \, {\rm psf} - \left(\frac{12 \, {\rm in.}}{12 \, {\rm in/ft}}\right) (150 \, {\rm pcf}) - \left(\frac{36 \, {\rm in.}}{12 \, {\rm in/ft}}\right) (100 \, {\rm pcf}) = 3550 \, {\rm psf}$$

Width of footing required =  $\frac{20 \, {\rm k} + 15 \, {\rm k}}{3.55 \, {\rm ksf}} = 9.86 \, {\rm ft}$ 

Say 10 ft 0 in.

Bearing Pressure for Strength Design for a 12 in. width

$$q_u = \frac{(1.2)(20 \text{ k}) + (1.6)(15 \text{ k})}{10.00 \text{ ft}^2} = 4.80 \text{ ksf}$$

Depth Required for Shear at a Distance d from Face of Wall (Figure 12.6)

$$\begin{split} V_u &= \left(\frac{10.00 \text{ ft}}{2} - \frac{6 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}} - \frac{8.5 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) (4.80 \text{ ksf}) = 18.20 \text{ k} \\ d &= \frac{18,200 \text{ lb}}{(0.75) \left(2\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}\right) (12 \text{ in.})} = 18.46 \text{ in.} \\ h &= 18.46 \text{ in.} + 3.5 \text{ in.} = 21.96 \text{ in.} > 12 \text{ in.} \end{split}$$
 Try again

Assume 20-in. Footing (d = 16.5 in.)

$$q_{\rm e} = 4000 \ {\rm psf} - \left(\frac{20 \ {\rm in.}}{12 \ {\rm in/ft}}\right) (150 \ {\rm pcf}) - \left(\frac{28 \ {\rm in.}}{12 \ {\rm in/ft}}\right) (100 \ {\rm pcf}) = 3517 \ {\rm psf}$$

$${\rm Width \ required} = \frac{20 \ {\rm k} + 15 \ {\rm k}}{3.517 \ {\rm ksf}} = 9.95 \ {\rm ft}$$

$${\rm Say \ 10 \ ft \ 0 \ in.}$$

#### **Depth Required for Shear**

$$\begin{split} V_u &= \left(\frac{10.00 \text{ ft}}{2} - \frac{6 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}} - \frac{16.50 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) (4.80) = 15.0 \text{ k} \\ d &= \frac{15,000 \text{ lb}}{(0.75) (2\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi)} (12 \text{ in.})} = 15.21 \text{ in.} \\ h &= 15.21 \text{ in.} + 3.5 \text{ in.} = 18.71 \text{ in.} & \text{Use 20-in. total depth} \end{split}$$

(A subsequent check of a 19-in. footing shows it will not quite work.)

#### Determine Steel Area (Using d = 16.5 in.)

Taking moments at face of wall (Figure 12.6),

Cantilever length = 
$$\frac{10.00 \text{ ft}}{2} - \frac{6 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}} = 4.50 \text{ ft}$$
  
 $M_u = (4.50 \text{ ft}) (4.80 \text{ klf}) (2.25 \text{ ft}) = 48.6 \text{ ft-k}$

From Appendix A, Table A.12,  $\rho = 0.00345$  (by interpolation). Since this value of  $\rho$  is less than 0.0136 (from Table A.7), the section is tension controlled and  $\phi = 0.9$  as assumed.

$$A_s = (0.00345)(12 \text{ in.})(16.5 \text{ in.}) = 0.68 \text{ in.}^2$$
 Use #7 @ 10 in. (0.72 in.<sup>2</sup> from Table A.6)

#### **Development Length**

From Table 7.1 in Chapter 7

Letting 
$$K_{tr} = 0$$
 
$$\frac{c_b + K_{tr}}{d_b} = \frac{3.5 \text{ in.} + 0 \text{ in.}}{0.875 \text{ in.}} = 4.0 > 2.5$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} = \frac{3}{40} \frac{f_y}{\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}} \frac{\psi_t \psi_e \psi_s}{\frac{c + K_{tr}}{d_b}}$$
 
$$= \left(\frac{3}{40}\right) \left(\frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{(1)\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}}\right) \frac{(1.0)(1.0)(1.0)}{2.5} = 32.86 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} \frac{A_{s \text{ reqd}}}{A_{s \text{ furn}}} = (32.86) \left(\frac{0.68 \text{ in.}^2}{0.72 \text{ in.}^2}\right) = 31.03 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\ell_d = (31.03)(0.875 \text{ in.}) = 27.15 \text{ in.}$$
 Say 28 in.

$$\begin{pmatrix} \text{Available development length} \\ \text{assuming bars are cut off} \\ \text{3 in. from edge of footing} \end{pmatrix} = \frac{10 \text{ ft}}{2} - 6 \text{ in.} - 3 \text{ in.}$$

$$= \begin{pmatrix} 4 \text{ ft 3 in. from face of} \\ \text{wall at section of} \\ \text{maximum moment} \end{pmatrix} > 28 \text{ in.}$$

(The bars should be extended to a point not less than 3 in. or more than 6 in. from the edge of the footing.)

 Use #5 @ 8 in.

### 12.6 Design of Square Isolated Footings

Single-column footings usually provide the most economical column foundations. Such footings are generally square in plan, but they can just as well be rectangular or even circular or octagonal. Rectangular footings are used where such shapes are dictated by the available space or where the cross sections of the columns are very pronounced rectangles.

Most footings consist of slabs of constant thickness, such as the one shown in Figure 12.7(a), but if calculated thicknesses are greater than 3 ft or 4 ft, it may be economical to use stepped footings, as illustrated in Figure 12.7(b). The shears and moments in a footing are obviously larger near the column, with the result that greater depths are required in that area as compared to the outer parts of the footing. For very large footings, such as those used for bridge piers, stepped footings can give appreciable savings in concrete quantities.

Occasionally, sloped footings, shown in Figure 12.7(c), are used instead of stepped ones, but labor costs can be a problem. Whether stepped or sloped, it is considered necessary to place the concrete for the entire footing in a single pour to ensure the construction of a monolithic structure, thus avoiding horizontal shearing weakness. If this procedure is not followed, it is desirable to use keys or shear friction reinforcing between the parts to ensure monolithic action. In addition, when sloped or stepped footings are used, it is necessary to check stresses at more than one section in the footing. For example, steel area and development length requirements should be checked at steps as well as at the faces of walls or columns.

**FI GU RE 12.7** Shapes of isolated footings.

Before a column footing can be designed, it is necessary to make a few comments regarding shears and moments. This is done in the paragraphs to follow, while a related subject, load transfer from columns to footings, is discussed in Section 12.8.

#### **Shears**

Two shear conditions must be considered in column footings, regardless of their shapes. The first of these is one-way or beam shear, which is the same as that considered in wall footings in the preceding section. For this discussion, reference is made to the footing of Figure 12.8. The total shear  $(V_{u1})$  to be taken along section 1–1 equals the net soil pressure,  $q_u$ , times the hatched area outside the section. In the expression to follow,  $b_w$  is the whole width of the footing. The maximum value of  $V_{u1}$  if stirrups are not used equals  $\phi V_c$ , which is  $\phi 2\sqrt{f_c'}b_w d$ , and the maximum depth required is as follows:

![](_page_378_Figure_5.jpeg)

FIGURE 12.8 One-way or beam shear.

The second shear condition is two-way or punching shear (see Figure 12.9). The compression load from the column tends to spread out into the footing, opposing diagonal tension in that area, with the result that a square column tends to punch out a piece of the slab, which has the shape of a truncated pyramid. The ACI Code (11.11.1.2) states that the critical section for two-way shear is located at a distance d/2 from the face of the column.

The shear force,  $V_{u2}$ , consists of all the net upward pressure,  $q_u$ , on the hatched area shown, that is, on the area outside the part tending to punch out. In the expressions to follow,  $b_o$  is the perimeter around the punching area, equal to 4(a+d) in Figure 12.9. The nominal two-way shear strength of the concrete,  $V_c$ , is specified as the smallest value obtained by substituting into the applicable equations that follow.

The first expression is the usual punching shear strength

$$V_c = 4\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o d$$
 (ACI Equation 11-35)

Tests have shown that when rectangular footing slabs are subjected to bending in two directions and when the long side of the loaded area is more than two times the length of the short side, the shear strength  $V_c = 4\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o d$  may be much too high. In the expression to follow,  $\beta_c$  is the ratio of the long side of the column to the short side of the column, concentrated load, or reaction area.

$$V_c = \left(2 + \frac{4}{\beta_c}\right) \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o d \qquad (ACI Equation 11-33)$$

![](_page_379_Figure_9.jpeg)

FIGURE 12.9 Two-way or punching shear.

The shear stress in a footing increases as the ratio  $b_o/d$  decreases. To account for this fact, ACI Equation 11-34 was developed. The equation includes a term  $\alpha_s$  that is used to account for variations in the ratio. In applying the equation,  $\alpha_s$  is to be used as 40 for interior columns (where the perimeter is four-sided), 30 for edge columns (where the perimeter is three-sided), and 20 for corner columns (where the perimeter is two-sided).

$$V_c = \left(\frac{\alpha_s d}{b_o} + 2\right) \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o d$$
 (ACI Equation 11-34)

The d required for two-way shear is the largest value obtained from the following expressions:

$$d = \frac{V_{u2}}{\phi 4\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}b_o}$$

$$d = \frac{V_{u2}}{\phi \left(2 + \frac{4}{\beta_c}\right)\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}b_o} \quad \text{(not applicable unless } \beta_c \text{ is } > 2\text{)}$$

$$d = \frac{V_{u2}}{\phi \left(\frac{\alpha_s d}{b_o} + 2\right)\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}b_o}$$

Or in SI units, with  $f'_c$  in MPa and  $b_o$  and d in mm,

$$d = \frac{6V_{u2}}{\phi\lambda\sqrt{f'_c}b_o}$$

$$d = \frac{6V_{u2}}{\phi\left(1 + \frac{8}{\beta_c}\right)\lambda\sqrt{f'_c}b_o}$$

$$d = \frac{12V_{u2}}{\phi\left(\frac{\alpha_s d}{b_o} + 2\right)\lambda\sqrt{f'_c}b_o}$$

#### **Moments**

The bending moment in a square reinforced concrete footing with a square column is the same about both axes because of symmetry. If the column is not square, the moment will be larger in the direction of the shorter column dimension. It should be noted, however, that the effective depth of the footing cannot be the same in the two directions because the bars in one direction rest on top of the bars in the other direction. The effective depth used for calculations might be the average for the two directions or, more conservatively, the value for the bars on top. This lesser value is used for the examples in this text. Although the result is some excess of steel in one direction, it is felt that the steel in either direction must be sufficient to resist the moment in that direction. It should be clearly understood that having an excess of steel in one direction will not make up for a shortage in the other direction at a 90° angle.

The critical section for bending is taken at the face of a reinforced concrete column or halfway between the middle and edge of a masonry wall or at a distance halfway from the edge of the base plate and the face of the column if structural steel columns are used (Code 15.4.2).

The determination of footing depths by the procedure described here will often require several cycles of a trial-and-error procedure. There are, however, many tables and handbooks available with which footing depths can be accurately estimated. One of these is the previously mentioned CRSI Design Handbook. In addition, there are many rules of thumb used by designers for making initial thickness estimates, such as 20% of the footing width or the column diameter plus 3 in. Computer programs, such as the spreadsheet provided for this chapter, easily handle this problem.

The reinforcing steel area calculated for footings will often be appreciably less than the minimum values  $(200b_w d/f_v)$  and  $(3\sqrt{f_v}b_w d/f_v)$  specified for flexural members in ACI Section 10.5.1. In Section 10.5.4, however, the code states that in slabs of uniform thickness, the minimum area and maximum spacing of reinforcing bars in the direction of bending need only be equal to those required for shrinkage and temperature reinforcement. The maximum spacing of this reinforcement may not exceed the lesser of three times the footing thickness, or 18 in. Many designers feel that the combination of high shears and low  $\rho$  values that often occurs in footings is not a good situation. Because of this, they specify steel areas at least as large as the flexural minimums of ACI Section 10.5.1. This is the practice we also follow herein

Example 12.2 illustrates the design of an isolated column footing.

#### Example 12.2

Design a square column footing for a 16-in. square tied interior column that supports a dead load  $P_D = 200 \text{ k}$  and a live load  $P_L = 160 \text{ k}$ . The column is reinforced with eight #8 bars, the base of the footing is 5 ft below grade, the soil weight is 100 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>,  $f_v = 60,000$  psi,  $f_c' = 3000$  psi, and  $q_a = 5000 \text{ psf.}$ 

#### SOLUTION

After Two Previous Trials Assume 24-in. Footing (d = 19.5 in. Estimated to c.g. of *Top Layer* of Flexural Steel)

$$q_{\rm e} = 5000~{\rm psf} - \left(\frac{24~{\rm in.}}{12~{\rm in/ft}}\right) (150~{\rm pcf}) - \left(\frac{36~{\rm in.}}{12~{\rm in/ft}}\right) (100~{\rm psf}) = 4400~{\rm psf}$$
 Area required = 
$$\frac{200~{\rm k} + 160~{\rm k}}{4~400~{\rm ksf}} = 81.82~{\rm ft}^2$$

 $\underline{ \text{Use 9-ft-0-in.} \times \text{9-ft-0-in. footing} = 81.0 \text{ ft}^2}$ 

**Bearing Pressure for Strength Design** 

$$q_u = \frac{(1.2)(200 \text{ k}) + (1.6)(160 \text{ k})}{81.0 \text{ ft}^2} = 6.12 \text{ ksf}$$

Depth Required for Two-Way or Punching Shear (Figure 12.10)

$$b_o = (4) (35.5 \text{ in.}) = 142 \text{ in.}$$

$$V_{u2} = (81.0 \text{ ft}^2 - 2.96 \text{ ft}^2) (6.12 \text{ ksf}) = 442.09 \text{ k}$$

$$d = \frac{442,090 \text{ lb}}{(0.75) (4\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}) (142 \text{ in.})} = 18.95 \text{ in.} < 19.5 \text{ in.} \qquad \underline{OK}$$

$$d = \frac{442,090 \text{ lb}}{0.75 \left(\frac{40 \text{ in.} \times 19.5 \text{ in.}}{142 \text{ in.}} + 2\right) \sqrt{3000} \text{ psi} (142 \text{ in.})} = 10.12 \text{ in.} < 19.5 \text{ in.} \qquad \underline{OK}$$

Since both values of d are less than the assumed value of 19.5 in., punching shear is OK.

**FIGURE 12.10** Two-way shear for Example 12.2.

![](_page_382_Figure_4.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12.11** One-way shear for Example 12.2.

#### Depth Required for One-Way Shear (Figure 12.11)

$$V_{u1} = (9.00 \text{ ft}) (2.208 \text{ ft}) (6.12 \text{ ksf}) = 121.62 \text{ k}$$
 
$$d = \frac{121,620 \text{ lb}}{(0.75) (2\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}) (108 \text{ in.})} = 13.71 \text{ in.} < 19.5 \text{ in.} \quad \underline{OK}$$

Use 24-in. total depth

$$\begin{split} M_u &= (3.83 \text{ ft}) (9.00 \text{ ft}) (6.12 \text{ ksf}) \left(\frac{3.83 \text{ ft}}{2}\right) = 404 \text{ ft-k} \\ \frac{M_u}{\phi b d^2} &= \frac{(12 \text{ in/ft}) (404,000 \text{ ft-lb})}{(0.9) (108 \text{ in.}) (19.5 \text{ in.})^2} = 131.2 \text{ psi} \qquad \therefore \rho = 0.00225 < \rho_{\text{min}} \text{ for flexure} \\ \text{Use } \rho &= \text{larger of } \frac{200}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.0033 \leftarrow \\ \text{or } \frac{3\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.00274 \end{split}$$

 $A_s = (0.0033)(108 \text{ in.})(19.5 \text{ in.}) = 6.95 \text{ in.}^2 \text{ over the entire } 108 \text{ in. width.}$ 

Use 9 #8 bars in both directions (7.07 in.2)

#### **Development Length**

From Table 6.1 in Chapter 6

$$\psi_t = \psi_e = \psi_s = \lambda = 1.0$$

Assuming bars spaced 12 in. on center

leaving 6 in. on each side

$$c_b = \text{bottom cover} = 3.5 \text{ in.}$$

$$c_b = ext{one-half of center-to-center spacing of bars} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (12 \text{ in.}) = 6 \text{ in.}$$

Letting 
$$K_{tr} = 0$$
 
$$\frac{c_b + K_{tr}}{d_b} = \frac{3.5 \text{ in.} + 0 \text{ in.}}{1.0 \text{ in.}} = 3.5 > 2.5$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} = \frac{3}{40} \frac{f_y}{\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}} \frac{\psi_t \psi_e \psi_s}{c + K_{tr}}$$
 
$$= \frac{3}{40} \frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{(1.0)\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}} \frac{(1.0)(1.0)(1.0)}{2.5}$$
 
$$= 32.86 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} \frac{A_{\text{s reqd}}}{A_{\text{s furn}}} = (32.86) \left(\frac{6.95 \text{ in.}^2}{7.07 \text{ in.}^2}\right) = 32.30 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\ell_d = (32.30)(1.00 \text{ in.}) = 32.30 \text{ in.}$$
 
$$< \text{available } \ell_d = 4 \text{ ft } 6 \text{ in.} - \frac{16 \text{ in.}}{2} - 3 \text{ in.}$$
 
$$= 43 \text{ in.} \qquad \underline{OK}$$

### Footings Supporting Round or Regular **Polygon-Shaped Columns**

Sometimes footings are designed to support round columns or regular polygon-shaped columns. If such is the case, Section 15.3 of the code states that the column may be replaced with a square member that has the same area as the round or polygonal one. The equivalent square is then used for locating the critical sections for moment, shear, and development length.

### Load Transfer from Columns to Footings

All forces acting at the base of a column must be satisfactorily transferred into the footing. Compressive forces can be transmitted directly by bearing, whereas uplift or tensile forces must be transferred to the supporting footing or pedestal by means of developed reinforcing bars or by mechanical connectors (which are often used in precast concrete).

A column transfers its load directly to the supporting footing over an area equal to the cross-sectional area of the column. The footing surrounding this contact area, however, supplies appreciable lateral support to the directly loaded part, with the result that the loaded concrete in the footing can support more load. Thus, for the same grade of concrete, the footing can carry a larger bearing load than can the base of the column.

In checking the strength of the lower part of the column, only the concrete is counted. The column-reinforcing bars at that point cannot be counted because they are not developed unless dowels are provided or unless the bars themselves are extended into the footing.

At the base of the column, the permitted bearing strength is  $\phi(0.85f'_cA_1)$  (where  $\phi$  is 0.65), but it may be multiplied by  $\sqrt{A_2/A_1} \le 2$  for bearing on the footing (ACI Code 10.14.1). In these expressions,  $A_1$  is the column area, and  $A_2$  is the area of the portion of the supporting footing that is geometrically similar and concentric with the columns. (See Figure 12.12.)

Pier bases for bridge from Prince Edward Island to mainland New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada.

If the computed bearing force is higher than the smaller of the two allowable values in the column or the footing, it will be necessary to carry the excess with dowels or with column bars extended into the footing. Instead of using dowels, it is also possible to increase the size of the column or increase *f <sup>c</sup>* . Should the computed bearing force be less than the allowable value, no dowels or extended reinforcing are theoretically needed, but the code (15.8.2.1) states that there must be a minimum area of dowels furnished equal to no less than 0.005 times the gross cross-sectional area of the column or pedestal.

**FI GU RE 12.12** Bearing strength area modification.

![](_page_385_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 12.13** Dowel configuration.

The development length of the bars must be sufficient to transfer the compression to the supporting member, as per the ACI Code (12.3). In no case may the area of the designed reinforcement or dowels be less than the area specified for the case where the allowable bearing force was not exceeded. As a practical matter in placing dowels, it should be noted that regardless of how small a distance they theoretically need to be extended down into the footing, they are usually bent at their ends and set on the main footing reinforcing, as shown in Figure 12.13. There the dowels can be tied firmly in place and not be in danger of being pushed through the footing during construction, as might easily happen otherwise. The bent part of the bar does not count as part of the compression development length (ACI Code 12.5.5). The reader should again note that the bar details shown in this figure are not satisfactory for seismic areas as the bars should be bent inward and not outward.

An alternative to the procedure described in the preceding paragraph is to place the footing concrete without dowels and then to push straight dowels down into the concrete while it is still in a plastic state. This practice is permitted by the code in its Section 16.7.1 and is especially useful for plain concrete footings (to be discussed in Section 12.14 of this chapter). It is essential that the dowels be maintained in their correct position as long as the concrete is plastic. Before the licensed design professional approves the use of straight dowels as described here, he or she must be satisfied that the dowels will be properly placed and the concrete satisfactorily compacted around them.

The code normally does not permit the use of lapped splices for #14 and #18 compression bars because tests have shown that welded splices or other types of connections are necessary. Nevertheless, based on years of successful use, the code (15.8.2.3) states that #14 and #18 bars may be lap spliced with dowels (no larger than #11) to provide for force transfer at the base of columns or walls or pedestals. These dowels must extend into the supported member a distance of not less than l*dc* of #14 or #18 bars or the compression lap splice length of the dowels, whichever is greater, and into the footing a distance not less than l*dc* of the dowels.

If the computed development length of dowels is greater than the distance available from the top of the footing down to the top of the tensile steel, three possible solutions are available. One or more of the following alternatives may be selected:

- **1.** A larger number of smaller dowels may be used. The smaller diameters will result in smaller development lengths.
- **2.** A deeper footing may be used.
- **3.** A cap or pedestal may be constructed on top of the footing to provide the extra development length needed.

Should bending moments or uplift forces have to be transferred to a footing such that the dowels would be in tension, the development lengths must satisfy the requirements for tension bars. For tension development length into the footing, a hook at the bottom of the dowel may be considered effective.

If there is moment or uplift, it will be necessary for the designer to conform to the splice requirements of Section 12.17 of the code in determining the distance the dowels must be extended up into the wall or column.

Examples 12.3 and 12.4 provide brief examples of column-to-footing load transfer calculations for vertical forces only. Consideration is given to lateral forces and moments in Sections 12.12 and 12.13 of this chapter.

#### Example 12.3

Design for load transfer from a 16-in.  $\times$  16-in. column to a 9-ft-0-in.  $\times$  9-ft-0-in. footing if  $P_D = 200 \text{ k}$ ,  $P_L = 160 \text{ k}$ ,  $f_c' = 3000 \text{ psi}$  for the footing and 4000 psi for the column, and  $f_y = 60,000 \text{ psi}$ . The footing concrete is normal weight, but the column is constructed with sand-lightweight concrete.

#### SOLUTION

Bearing force at base of column = (1.2)(200 k) + (1.6)(160 k) = 496 kAllowable bearing force in concrete at base of column

$$= \phi(0.85f'_cA_1) = (0.65)(0.85)(4.0 \text{ ksi})(16 \text{ in.} \times 16 \text{ in.})$$
  
= 566 k > 496 k  $\therefore$  column bearing is OK

Allowable bearing force in footing concrete =  $\phi(0.85f'_cA_1)\sqrt{A_2/A_1}$ 

$$\sqrt{\frac{A_2}{A_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{9 \text{ ft} \times 9 \text{ ft}}{1.33 \text{ ft} \times 1.33 \text{ ft}}} = 6.75 > 2.0$$

$$= (0.65) (0.85) (3.0) (16 \text{ in.} \times 16 \text{ in.}) (Use 2)^{[1]} = 848.6 \text{ k} > 496 \text{ k} \quad \therefore \text{ Footing bearing is OK}$$

Minimum  $A_s$  for dowels = (0.005) (16 in. × 16 in.) = 1.28 in.<sup>2</sup> Use 4 #6 bars (1.77 in.<sup>2</sup>)

#### **Development Lengths of Dowels (ACI 12.3)**

For the column, using  $\lambda = 0.85$  for sand-lightweight concrete and  $f'_c = 4000$  psi,

$$\ell_d = \frac{0.02 d_b f_y}{\lambda \sqrt{f_C'}} = \frac{0.02 (0.75 \text{ in.}) (60,000 \text{ psi})}{0.85 \sqrt{4000} \text{ psi}} = 16.74 \text{ in.}$$

For the footing,  $\lambda = 1.0$  and  $f'_{c} = 3000$  psi,

$$\ell_d = \frac{0.02 d_b f_y}{\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}} = \frac{0.02 (0.75 \text{ in.}) (60,000 \text{ psi})}{1.0 \sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}} = 16.43 \text{ in.}$$

In addition, the development must not be less than either

$$\ell_d = 0.0003 d_b f_y = 0.0003 (0.75 \text{ in.}) (60,000 \text{ psi}) = 13.50 \text{ in.}$$
  $\ell_d = 8.00 \text{ in.}$ 

In summary, the dowels must extend upward into the column at least 16.74 in. and down into the footing at least 16.43 in. Use four #6 dowels extending 17 in. up into the column and 17 in. down into the footing and set on top of the reinforcing mat, as shown in Figure 12.13.

 $<sup>\</sup>sqrt{A_2/A_1}$  < 2.0. (ACI Code Section 10.14.1)

#### Example 12.4

Design for load transfer from a 14-in. × 14-in. column to a 13-ft-0-in. × 13-ft-0-in. footing with a  $P_u$  of 800 k,  $f_c' = 3000$  psi in the footing and 5000 psi in the column, both normal weight, and  $f_{v} = 60,000$  psi. The column has eight #8 bars.

#### SOLUTION

Bearing force at base of column =  $P_u = 800 \text{ k}$ 

 $= \phi$ (allowable bearing force in concrete)  $+ \phi$ (strength of dowels)

Design bearing strength in concrete at base of column

$$= (0.65)(0.85)(5.0 \text{ ksi})(14 \text{ in.} \times 14 \text{ in.}) = 541.5 \text{ k} < 800 \text{ k}$$
 No good

Design bearing strength on footing concrete

$$\sqrt{\frac{A_2}{A_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{(13 \text{ ft})(13 \text{ ft})}{(1.17 \text{ ft})(1.17 \text{ ft})}} = 11.1 > 2$$

$$= (0.65) \, (0.85) \, (3.0 \text{ ksi}) \, (14 \text{ in.} \times 14 \text{ in.}) \, (\text{Use 2})^{\text{[2]}} = 649.7 \text{ k} < 800 \text{ k} \qquad \underline{\text{No good}}$$

Therefore, the dowels must be designed for excess load.

Excess load = 
$$800 \text{ k} - 541.5 \text{ k} = 258.5 \text{ k}$$

$$A_{\rm s}$$
 of dowels =  $\frac{258.5 \text{ k}}{(0.9)(60 \text{ ksi})} = \frac{4.79 \text{ in.}^2}{2000}$  or  $(0.005)(14 \text{ in.})(14 \text{ in.}) = 0.98 \text{ in.}^2$ 

Use 8 #7 bars (4.80 in.2)

**Development Length of #7 Dowels into Column** 

$$\ell_d = \frac{(0.02)\,(0.875\,\text{in.})\,(60,000\,\text{psi})}{(1.0)\sqrt{5000}\,\text{psi}} = 14.85\,\text{in.}$$
 
$$\ell_d = (0.0003)\,(60,000\,\text{psi})\,(0.875\,\text{in.}) = 15.75\,\text{in.} \leftarrow$$
 
$$\ell_d = 8\,\text{in.}$$

Development Length of #7 Dowels into Footing (Different from Column Values because f'c Values Are Different)

$$\ell_d = \frac{(0.02)(0.875 \text{ in.})(60,000 \text{ psi})}{(1.0)\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}} = 19.42 \text{ in.} \leftarrow$$

 $\ell_d = (0.0003)(0.875 \text{ in.})(60,000 \text{ psi}) = 15.75 \text{ in.}$ 

Use eight #7 dowels extending 16 in. up into the column and 20 in. down into the footing.

 $<sup>^2\</sup>sqrt{A_2/A_1}$  < 2.0. (See Section 12.8 and ACI Code Section 10.14.1.)

### 12.9 Rectangular Isolated Footings

As previously mentioned, isolated footings may be rectangular in plan if the column has a very pronounced rectangular shape or if the space available for the footing forces the designer into using a rectangular shape. Should a square footing be feasible, it is normally more desirable than a rectangular one because it will require less material and will be simpler to construct.

The design procedure is almost identical with the one used for square footings. After the required area is calculated and the lateral dimensions are selected, the depths required for one-way and two-way shear are determined by the usual methods. One-way shear will very often control the depths for rectangular footings, whereas two-way shear normally controls the depths of square footings.

The next step is to select the reinforcing in the long direction. These longitudinal bars are spaced uniformly across the footing, but such is not the case for the short-span reinforcing. In Figure 12.14, it can be seen that the support provided by the footing to the column will be concentrated near the middle of the footing, and thus the moment in the short direction will be concentrated somewhat in the same area near the column.

As a result of this concentration effect, it seems only logical to concentrate a large proportion of the short-span reinforcing in this area. The code (15.4.4.2) states that a certain minimum percentage of the total short-span reinforcing should be placed in a band width equal to the length of the shorter direction of the footing. The amount of reinforcing in this band is to be determined with the following expression, in which  $\beta$  is the ratio of the length of the long side to the width of the short side of the footing:

$$\frac{\text{Reinforcing in band width}}{\text{Total reinforcing in short direction}} = \frac{2}{\beta + 1} = \gamma_s$$
 (ACI Equation 15-1)

The remaining reinforcing in the short direction should be uniformly spaced over the ends of the footing, but the authors feel it should at least meet the shrinkage and temperature requirements of the ACI Code (7.12).

Example 12.5 presents the partial design of a rectangular footing in which the depths for one- and two-way shears are determined and the reinforcement selected.

![](_page_388_Figure_10.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12.14** Band width for steel in the short direction for rectangular isolated footings.

#### Example 12.5

Design a rectangular footing for an 18-in, square interior column with a dead load of 185 k and a live load of 150 k. Make the length of the long side equal to twice the width of the short side,  $f_v = 60,000$  psi,  $f_c' = 4000$  psi, normal weight, and  $q_a = 4000$  psf. Assume the base of the footing is 5 ft 0 in. below grade.

#### SOLUTION

#### Assume 24-in. Footing (d = 19.5 in.)

If either value of d in the last two equations had exceeded the assumed value of 19.5 in., it would have been necessary to increase the trial value of d and start over.

### **12.10 Combined Footings**

Combined footings support more than one column. One situation in which they may be used is when the columns are so close together that isolated individual footings would run into each other [see Figure 12.18(a)]. Another frequent use of combined footings occurs where one column is very close to a property line, causing the usual isolated footing to extend across the line. For this situation, the footing for the exterior column may be combined with the one for an interior column, as shown in Figure 12.18(b).

On some occasions, where a column is close to a property line and where it is desired to combine its footing with that of an interior column, the interior column will be so far away as to make the idea impractical economically. For such a case, counterweights, or "deadmen," may be provided for the outside column to take care of the eccentric loading.

![](_page_391_Figure_7.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 12.18** Use of combined footings.

![](_page_392_Picture_2.jpeg)

Combined footing (two column) after footing concrete is placed showing column reinforcing ready for splicing.

Because it is desirable to make bearing pressures uniform throughout the footing, the centroid of the footing should be made to coincide with the centroid of the column loads to attempt to prevent uneven settlements. This can be accomplished with combined footings that are rectangular in plan. Should the interior column load be greater than that of the exterior column, the footing may be so proportioned that its centroid will be in the correct position by extending the inward projection of the footing, as shown in the rectangular footing of Figure 12.18(b).

Other combined footing shapes that will enable the designer to make the centroids coincide are the trapezoid and strap or T footings shown in Figure 12.19. Footings with these shapes are usually economical when there are large differences between the magnitudes of the column loads or where the spaces available do not lend themselves to long rectangular footings. When trapezoidal footings are used, the longitudinal bars are usually arranged in a fan shape with alternate bars cut off some distance from the narrow end.

You probably realize that a problem arises in establishing the centroids of loads and footings when deciding whether to use service or factored loads. The required centroid of the footing will be slightly different for the two cases. The authors determine the footing areas and centroids with the service loads (ACI Code 15.2.2), but the factored loads could be used with reasonable results, too. The important point is to be consistent throughout the entire problem.

The design of combined footings has not been standardized as have the procedures used for the previous problems worked in this chapter. For this reason, practicing reinforced concrete designers use slightly varying approaches. One of these methods is described in the paragraphs to follow.

First, the required area of the footing is determined for the service loads, and the footing dimensions are selected so that the centroids coincide. The various loads are then multiplied by the appropriate load factors, and the shear and moment diagrams are drawn along the long side

![](_page_393_Picture_2.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 12.19** Trapezoidal and strap or T footings.

of the footing for these loads. After the shear and moment diagrams are prepared, the depth for one- and two-way shear is determined, and the reinforcing in the long direction is selected.

In the short direction, it is assumed that each column load is spread over a width in the long direction equal to the column width plus *d*/2 on each side if that much footing is available. Then the steel is designed, and a minimum amount of steel for temperature and shrinkage is provided in the remaining part of the footing.

The ACI Code does not specify an exact width for these transverse strips, and designers may make their own assumptions as to reasonable values. The width selected will probably have very little influence on the transverse bending capacity of the footing, but it can affect appreciably its punching or two-way shear resistance. If the flexural reinforcing is placed within the area considered for two-way shear, this lightly stressed reinforcing will reduce the width of the diagonal shear cracks and will also increase the aggregate interlock along the shear surfaces.

Space is not taken here to design completely a combined footing, but Example 12.6 is presented to show those parts of the design that are different from the previous examples of this chapter. A comment should be made about the moment diagram. If the length of the footing is not selected so that its centroid is located exactly at the centroid of the column loads, the moment diagrams will not close well at all since the numbers are very sensitive. Nevertheless, it is considered good practice to round off the footing lateral dimensions to the nearest 3 in. Another factor that keeps the moment diagram from closing is the fact that the average load factors of the various columns will be different if the column loads are different. We could improve the situation a little by taking the total column factored loads and dividing the result by the total working loads to get an average load factor. This value (which works out to be 1.375 in Example 12.6) could then be multiplied by the total working load at each column and used for drawing the shear and moment diagrams.

#### Example 12.6

Design a rectangular combined footing for the two columns shown in Figure 12.20.  $q_a=5$  ksf,  $f_c'=3000$  psi, normal weight, and  $f_y=60$  ksi. The bottom of the footing is to be 6 ft below grade.

#### SOLUTION

#### Assume 27-in. Footing (d = 22.5 in.)

$$q_{\rm e} = 5000~{\rm psf} - \left(\frac{27~{\rm in.}}{12~{\rm in/ft}}\right) (150~{\rm pcf}) - \left(\frac{45~{\rm in.}}{12~{\rm in/ft}}\right) (100~{\rm pcf}) = 4287~{\rm psf}$$
 Area required 
$$= \frac{(120~{\rm k} + 100~{\rm k}) + (200~{\rm k} + 150~{\rm k})}{4.287~{\rm ksf}} = 132.96~{\rm ft}^2$$

#### **Locate Center of Gravity of Column Service Loads**

x from c.g. of left column = 
$$\frac{(200 \text{ k} + 150 \text{ k})(12 \text{ ft})}{(120 \text{ k} + 100 \text{ k}) + (200 \text{ k} + 150 \text{ k})} = 7.37 \text{ ft}$$

Distance from property line to c.g. = 0.75 ft + 7.37 ft = 8.12 ft

Length of footing = 
$$(2 \times 8.12 \text{ ft}) = 16.24 \text{ ft}$$
, say 16 ft 3 in.

Required footing width = 
$$\frac{\text{Area required}}{\text{length}} = \frac{132.96 \text{ ft}^2}{16.25 \text{ ft}} = 8.182 \text{ ft}$$

Use 16-ft-3-in. × 8-ft-3-in. footing ( $A = 134 \text{ ft}^2$ ).

$$q_u = \frac{(1.2)(320 \text{ k}) + (1.6)(250 \text{ k})}{134 \text{ ft}^2} = 5.85 \text{ ksf}$$

#### **Depth Required for One-Way Shear**

From the shear diagram in Figure 12.21, the largest shear force is 271.1 k at the left face of the right column. At a distance d to the left of this location, the value of shear is

$$V_{u1} = 271.1 \text{ k} - 48.26 \text{ klf} \left(\frac{22.5 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) = 180.61 \text{ k}$$
 
$$d = \frac{V_{u1}}{\phi 2\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}b} = \frac{180,610 \text{ lb}}{0.75(2) (1)\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi (8.25 ft) (12 in/ft)}} = 22.2 \text{ in.} < 22.5 \text{ in.} \qquad \underline{OK}$$

#### Depth Required for Two-Way Shear (ACI Equations 11.31 and 11.32 Not Shown as They Do **Not Control)**

$$V_{u2}$$
 at right column = 480 k  $-\left(\frac{42.5 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right)^2$  (5.85 ksf) = 406.6 k 
$$d = \frac{406,600 \text{ lb}}{(0.75) \left[ (4) (1.0) \sqrt{3000} \text{ psi} \right] (4 \times 42.5 \text{ in.})}$$
 = 14.56 in. < 22.5 in.  $\frac{OK}{A}$

FIGURE 12.21 Shear and moment diagrams for combined footing in Example 12.6.

$$V_{u2}$$
 at left column = 304 k -  $\left(\frac{29.25 \text{ in.} \times 40.5 \text{ in.}}{144 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}^2}\right)$  (5.85 ksf) = 255.9 k   
 
$$d = \frac{255,900 \text{ lb}}{(0.75) \left[ (4) (1.0) \sqrt{3000} \text{ psi} \right] (2 \times 29.25 \text{ in.} + 40.5 \text{ in.})}$$
 = 15.73 in. < 22.5 in.  $\frac{OK}{A}$ 

For this footing, one-way shear is more critical than two-way shear. This is not unusual for combined footings.

$$\rho = \rho_{\rm min}$$

Use larger of 
$$\frac{200}{f_y} = 0.00333$$
 or  $\frac{3\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.00274$ 

$$+A_s = (0.00333) (99 \text{ in.}) (22.5 \text{ in.}) = 7.42 \text{ in.}^2$$
 Use 8 #9 (8.00 in.<sup>2</sup>)

#### Design of Short-Span Steel Under Interior Column (Figure 12.22)

Assuming steel spread over width = column width + (2)  $\left(\frac{d}{2}\right)$ 

= 20 in. + (2) 
$$\left(\frac{22.5 \text{ in.}}{2}\right)$$
 = 42.5 in.

Referring to Figure 12.22 and calculating  $M_{ij}$ :

$$\begin{split} q_u &= \frac{480 \text{ k}}{8.25 \text{ ft}} = 58.18 \text{ k/ft} \\ M_u &= (3.29 \text{ ft}) (58.18 \text{ k/ft}) \left(\frac{3.29 \text{ ft}}{2}\right) = 314.9 \text{ ft-k} \\ \frac{M_u}{\phi b d^2} &= \frac{(12 \text{ in/ft}) (314,900 \text{ ft-lb})}{(0.90) (42.5 \text{ in.}) (22.5 \text{ in.})^2} = 195.1 \text{ psi} \\ p &= 0.00339 \text{ (from Appendix A, Table A.12)} \\ A_s &= (0.00339) (4.25 \text{ in.}) (22.5 \text{ in.}) = 3.24 \text{ in.}^2 & \underline{\text{Use 6 \#7 (3.61 in.}^2)} \end{split}$$

Development lengths (not shown) check out OK.

FIGURE 12.22 Soil stress used in determining short span steel.

A similar procedure is used under the exterior column where the steel is spread over a width equal to 18 in. plus d/2, and not 18 in. plus 2(d/2), because sufficient room is not available on the property-line side of the column.

#### 12.11 Footing Design for Equal Settlements

If three men are walking along a road carrying a log on their shoulders (a statically indeterminate situation) and one of them decides to lower his shoulder by 1 in., the result will be a drastic effect on the load supported by the other men. In the same way, if the footings of a building should settle by different amounts, the shears and moments throughout the structure will be greatly changed. In addition, there will be detrimental effects on the fitting of doors, windows, and partitions. Should all the footings settle by the same amount, however, these adverse effects will not occur. Thus, equal settlement is the goal of the designer.

The footings considered in preceding sections have had their areas selected by taking the total dead plus live loads and dividing the sum by the allowable soil pressure. It would seem that if such a procedure were followed for all the footings of an entire structure, the result would be uniform settlements throughout—but geotechnical engineers have clearly shown that this assumption may be very much in error.

A better way to handle the problem is to attempt to design the footings so that the usual loads on each footing will cause approximately the same pressures. The usual loads consist of the dead loads plus the average percentage of live loads normally present. The usual percentage of live loads present varies from building to building. For a church, it might be almost zero, perhaps 25% to 30% for an office building, and maybe 75% or more for some warehouses or libraries. Furthermore, the percentage in one part of a building may be entirely different from that in some other part (offices, storage, etc.).

One way to handle the problem is to design the footing that has the highest ratio of live to dead load, compute the usual soil pressure under that footing using dead load plus the estimated average percentage of live load, and then determine the areas required for the other footings so their usual soil pressures are all the same. It should be remembered that the dead load plus 100% of the live load must not cause a pressure greater than the allowable soil pressure under any of the footings.

A student of soil mechanics will realize that this method of determining usual pressures, though not a bad design procedure, will not ensure equal settlements. This approach at best will only lessen the amounts of differential settlements. The student will remember first that large footings tend to settle more than small footings, even though their soil pressures are the same, because the large footings exert compression on a larger and deeper mass of soil. There are other items that can cause differential settlements. Different types of soils may be present at different parts of the building; part of the area may be in fill and part in cut: there may be mutual influence of one footing on another; and so forth.

Example 12.7 illustrates the usual load procedure for a group of five isolated footings.

### Example 12.7

Determine the footing areas required for the loads given in Table 12.2 so that the usual soil pressures will be equal. Assume that the usual live load percentage is 30% for all the footings, *qe* = 4 ksf.

#### **SOLUTION**

The largest percentage of live load to dead load occurs for footing *D*.

Area required for footing 
$$D = \frac{100 \text{ k} + 150 \text{ k}}{4 \text{ ksf}} = 62.5 \text{ ft}^2$$

Usual soil pressure under footing 
$$D = \frac{100 \text{ k} + (0.30)(150 \text{ k})}{62.5 \text{ ft}^2} = 2.32 \text{ ksf}$$

Computing the areas required for the other footings and determining their soil pressures under total service loads, we show the results in Table 12.3. Note from the last column in Table 12.3 that footing *D* is the only footing that will be stressed to its allowable bearing stress.

### **12.12 Footings Subjected to Axial Loads and Moments**

Walls or columns often transfer moments as well as vertical loads to their footings. These moments may be the result of gravity loads or lateral loads. Such a situation is represented by the vertical load *P* and the bending moment *M* shown in Figure 12.23.

Moment transfer from columns to footings depends on how the column–footing connection is constructed. Many designers treat the connection between columns and footings as a pinned connection. Others treat it as fixed, and still others treat it as somewhere in between. If it is truly pinned, no moment is transferred to the footing, and this section of the text is not applicable. If, however, it is treated as fixed or partially fixed, this section is applicable.

If a column–footing joint is to behave as a pin or hinge, it would have to be constructed accordingly. The reinforcing in the column might be terminated at the column base instead of continuing into the footing. Dowels would be provided, but these would not be adequate to provide a moment connection.

To provide continuity at the column–footing interface, the reinforcing steel would have to be continued into the footing. This is normally accomplished by embedding hooked bars into the footing and having them extend into the air where the columns will be located. The length they extend into the air must be at least the lap splice length; sometimes this can be a significant length. These bars are then lap spliced or mechanically spliced with the column bars, providing continuity of tension force in the reinforcing steel.

If there is a moment transfer from the column to the footing, the resultant force will not coincide with the centroid of the footing. Of course, if the moment is constant in magnitude and direction, it will be possible to place the center of the footing under the resultant load and avoid the eccentricity, but lateral forces such as wind and earthquake can come from any direction, and symmetrical footings will be needed.

The effect of the moment is to produce a linearly varying soil pressure, which can be determined at any point with the expression

$$q = -\frac{P}{A} \pm \frac{Mc}{I}$$

In this discussion, the term *kern* is used. If the resultant force strikes the footing base within the kern, the value of −*P*/*A* is larger than + *Mc*/*I* at every point, and the entire footing base is in compression, as shown in Figure 12.23(a). If the resultant force strikes the footing base outside the kern, the value of + *Mc*/*I* will at some points be larger than −*P*/*A*, and there will be uplift or tension. The soil–footing interface cannot resist tension, and the pressure variation will be as shown in Figure 12.23(b). The location of the kern can be determined by replacing *Mc*/*I* with *Pec*/*I*, equating it to *P*/*A*, and solving for *e*.

**FIGURE 12.24** Soil stress distribution for eccentricity exceeding the kern eccentricity.

Should the eccentricity be larger than this value, the method described for calculating soil pressures  $[(-P/A) \pm (Mc/I)]$  is not correct. To compute the pressure for such a situation, it is necessary to realize that the centroid of the upward pressure must for equilibrium coincide with the centroid of the vertical component of the downward load. In Figure 12.24, it is assumed that the distance to this point from the right edge of the footing is a. Since the centroid of a triangle is located at one-third of its base, the soil pressure will be spread over the distance 3a as shown. For a rectangular footing with dimensions  $\ell \times b$ , the total upward soil pressure is equated to the downward load, and the resulting expression is solved for  $q_{\text{max}}$  as follows:

$$\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(3ab)(q_{\text{max}}) = P$$
$$q_{\text{max}} = \frac{2P}{3ab}$$

Example 12.8 shows that the required area of a footing subjected to a vertical load and a lateral moment can be determined by trial and error. The procedure is to assume a size, calculate the maximum soil pressure, compare it with the allowable pressure, assume another size, and so on.

Once the area has been established, the remaining design will be handled as it was for other footings. Although the shears and moments are not uniform, the theory of design is unchanged. The factored loads are computed, the bearing pressures are determined, and the shears and moments are calculated. For strength design, the footing must be proportioned for the effects of these loads as required in ACI Section 9.2.

#### Example 12.8

Determine the width needed for a wall footing to support loads: D=18 k/ft and L=12 k/ft. In addition, a moment of 39 ft-k must be transferred from the column to the footing. Assume the footing is 18 in. thick, its base is 4 ft below the final grade, and  $q_a=4$  ksf.

#### SOLUTION

#### **First Trial**

Neglecting moment 
$$q_{\rm e}=4000~{\rm pcf}-\left(\frac{18~{\rm in.}}{12~{\rm in/ft}}\right)$$
 (150 pcf)  $-\left(\frac{30~{\rm in.}}{12~{\rm in/ft}}\right)$  (100 pcf)  $=3525~{\rm psf}$  Width required  $=\frac{18~{\rm k}+12~{\rm k}}{3.525~{\rm ksf}}=8.51~{\rm ft}$ 

$$A = (9 \text{ ft}) (1 \text{ ft}) = 9 \text{ ft}^2$$

$$I = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (1 \text{ ft}) (9 \text{ ft})^3 = 60.75 \text{ ft}^4$$

$$q_{\text{max}} = -\frac{P}{A} - \frac{Mc}{I} = -\frac{30 \text{ k}}{9 \text{ ft}^2} - \frac{(39 \text{ ft-k}) (4.5 \text{ ft})}{60.75 \text{ ft}^4} \quad \text{(where minus = compression)}$$

$$= -6.22 \text{ ksf} > 3.525 \text{ ksf} \qquad \underline{\text{No good}}$$

$$q_{\text{min}} = -\frac{P}{A} + \frac{Mc}{I} = -\frac{30 \text{ k}}{9 \text{ ft}^2} + \frac{(39 \text{ ft-k}) (4.5 \text{ ft})}{60.75 \text{ ft}^4} = -0.44 \text{ ksf}$$

#### Second Trial

Assume 14-ft-wide footing (after a check of a 13-ft-wide footing proves it to be insufficient)

$$A = (14 \text{ ft}) (1 \text{ ft}) = 14 \text{ ft}^{2}$$

$$I = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (1 \text{ ft}) (14 \text{ ft})^{3} = 228.7 \text{ ft}^{4}$$

$$q_{\text{max}} = -\frac{30 \text{ k}}{14 \text{ ft}^{2}} - \frac{(39 \text{ ft-k}) (7 \text{ ft})}{228.7 \text{ ft}^{4}} = -3.34 \text{ ksf} < 3.525 \text{ ksf} \quad \underline{OK}$$

$$q_{\text{min}} = -\frac{30 \text{ k}}{14 \text{ ft}^{2}} + \frac{(39 \text{ ft-k}) (7 \text{ ft})}{228.7 \text{ ft}^{4}} = -0.95 \text{ ksf} \quad \underline{OK}$$

$$\underline{Use 14 \text{ ft 0 in. footing}}$$

Note that in both trials, the sign for  $q_{\min}$  is negative, meaning that the soil-footing interface is in compression. Had the value been positive, the equations used to calculate stress would not have been valid. Instead, the designer would have to use the equation

$$q_{\text{max}} = \frac{2P}{3ab}$$

Footings must be designed to resist all applicable load combinations from ACI Section 9.2. The experienced designer can often guess which will be most critical, design the footing accordingly, and check the others to see that the footing can resist them. Experience and computer programs help immensely in this process.

#### 12.13 Transfer of Horizontal Forces

When it is necessary to transfer horizontal forces from walls or columns to footings, the shear friction method discussed in Section 8.12 of this text or other appropriate means should be used (ACI Section 15.8.1.4). Sometimes shear keys (see Figure 13.1 in Chapter 13) are used between walls or columns and footings. This practice is of rather questionable value, however, because appreciable slipping has to occur to develop a shear key. A shear key may be thought of as providing an additional mechanical safety factor, but none of the lateral design force should be assigned to it.

The following example illustrates the consideration of lateral force transfer by the shear friction concept.

#### Example 12.9

A 14-in.  $\times$  14-in. column is supported by a 13-ft-0-in.  $\times$  13-ft-0-in. footing  $[f_c'=3000\ psi\ (normal\ weight)$  and  $f_y=60,000\ psi$  for both]. For vertical compression force transfer, six #6 dowels (2.65 in.²) were selected extending 18 in. up into the column and 18 in. down into the footing. Design for a horizontal factored force  $V_u$  of 65 k acting at the base of the column. Assume that the footing concrete has not been intentionally roughened before the column concrete is placed. Thus,  $\mu=0.6\lambda=(0.6)\ (1.0)\ for\ normal-weight\ concrete = 0.6.$  (See ACI Code 11.6.4.)

#### SOLUTION

**Determine Minimum Shear Friction Reinforcement Required by ACI Section 11.6.4** 

$$V_n = \frac{V_u}{\phi} = \frac{65 \text{ k}}{0.75} = 86.7 \text{ k}$$

$$V_n = A_{vf} f_y \mu \qquad \qquad \text{(ACI Equation 11-25)}$$

$$A_{vf} = \frac{86.7 \text{ k}}{(60 \text{ ksi})(0.6)} = 2.41 \text{ in.}^2 < 2.65 \text{ in.}^2 \qquad \underline{OK}$$

The six #6 dowels (2.65 in.<sup>2</sup>) present may also be used as shear friction reinforcing. If their area had not been sufficient, it could have been increased and/or the value of  $\mu$  could be increased significantly by intentionally roughening the concrete, as permitted in Section 11.6.4.3 of the code.

#### **Check Tensile Development Lengths of These Dowels**

Shear friction reinforcing acts in tension and thus must have tensile anchorage on both sides of the shear plane. It must also engage the main reinforcing in the footing to prevent cracks from occurring between the shear reinforcing and the body of the concrete.

$$\text{Assuming } \frac{c + K_{tr}}{d_b} = 2.5$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} = \left(\frac{3}{40}\right) \left[\frac{60,000 \text{ psi}}{(1.0) \sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}}\right] \frac{(1.0) (1.0) (0.8)}{2.5} \left(\frac{2.41 \text{ in.}^2}{2.65 \text{ in.}^2}\right) = 23.91 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\ell_d = (23.91) (0.75 \text{ in.}) = 17.93 \text{ in.}$$
 Say 18 in.

#### Compute Maximum Shear Transfer Strength Permitted by the Code (11.6.5)

$$V_u \le \phi 0.2f_c' A_c$$
, but not  $> \phi(800A_c)$   
  $\le (0.75) (0.2) (3 \text{ ksi}) (14 \text{ in.} \times 14 \text{ in.}) = 88.2 \text{ k} > 65 \text{ k}$   
but not  $> (0.75) (800 \text{ lb/in.}^2) (14 \text{ in.} \times 14 \text{ in.}) = 117,600 \text{ lb} = 117.6 \text{ k}$  OK

### 12.14 Plain Concrete Footings

Occasionally, plain concrete footings are used to support light loads if the supporting soil is of good quality. Very often the widths and thicknesses of such footings are determined by rules of thumb, such as the depth of a plain footing must be equal to no less than the projection beyond the edges of the wall. In this section, however, a plain concrete footing is designed in accordance with the requirements of the ACI.

Chapter 22 of the ACI Code is devoted to the design of structural plain concrete. Structural plain concrete is defined as concrete that is completely unreinforced or that contains less than the minimum required amounts of reinforcing previously specified here for reinforced concrete members. The minimum compressive strength permitted for such concrete is 2500 psi,<sup>3</sup> as given in ACI Sections 22.2.3 and 1.1.1.

Structural plain concrete may be used only for (1) members continuously supported by soil or by other structural members that are capable of providing continuous support, (2) walls and pedestals, and (3) structural members with arch action where compression occurs for all loading cases (ACI Section 22.2.1).

The code (22.7.3 and 22.7.4) states that when plain concrete footings are supported by soil, they cannot have an edge thickness less than 8 in. and they cannot be used on piles. The critical sections for shear and moment for plain concrete footings are the same as for reinforced concrete footings.

In ACI Code Section 22.5, nominal bending and shear strengths are specified for structural plain concrete. The proportions of plain concrete members will nearly always be controlled by tensile strengths rather than shear strengths.

In the equations that follow,  $\phi = 0.60$  (ACI 9.3.5) for all cases, S is the elastic section modulus of uncracked members, and  $\beta_c$  is the ratio of the long side to the short side of the column or loaded area. In computing the strengths, whether flexural or shear, for concrete cast against soil, the overall thickness, h, is to be taken as 2 in. less than the actual thickness (ACI Section 22.4.7). This concrete is neglected to account for uneven excavation for the footing and for some loss of mixing water to the soil and other contamination.

#### **Bending Strength:**

$$M_n = 5\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}S$$
 (ACI Equation 22-2)

$$\phi M_n \ge M_u$$
 (ACI Equation 22-1)

Shear Strength for One-Way or Beam Action:

$$V_n = \frac{4}{3} \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} bh$$
 (ACI Equation 22-9)

$$\phi V_n \ge V_n$$
 (ACI Equation 22-8)

Shear Strength for Two-Way or Punching Action:

$$V_n = \left(\frac{4}{3} + \frac{8}{3\beta_c}\right) \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o h$$
(ACI Equation 22-10)
$$\leq 2.66 \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o h$$

In SI units

$$M_n = \frac{5}{12} \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} S$$
 (ACI M Equation 22-2)

$$V_n = \frac{1}{9} \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} bh$$
 (ACI M Equation 22-9)

$$V_n = \frac{1}{9} \left( 1 + \frac{2}{\beta_c} \right) \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o h \le \frac{2}{9} \lambda \sqrt{f_c'} b_o h$$
 (ACI M Equation 22-10)

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>3</sup> In SI units, it is 17 MPa.

On one hand, a plain concrete footing will obviously require considerably more concrete than will a reinforced one. On the other hand, the cost of purchasing reinforcing and placing it will be eliminated. Furthermore, the use of plain concrete footings will enable us to save construction time in that we don't have to order the reinforcing and place it before the concrete can be poured. Therefore, plain concrete footings may be economical on more occasions than one might realize.

Even though plain footings are designed in accordance with the ACI requirements, they should, at the very least, be reinforced in the longitudinal direction to keep temperature and shrinkage cracks within reason and to enable the footing to bridge over soft spots in the underlying soil. Example 12.10 presents the design of a plain concrete footing in accordance with the ACI Code.

#### Example 12.10

Design a plain concrete footing for a 12-in. reinforced concrete wall that supports a dead load of 12 k/ft, including the wall weight, and a 6-k/ft live load. The base of the footing is to be 5 ft below the final grade,  $f'_c = 3000$  psi, and  $q_a = 4000$  psf.

#### SOLUTION

Assume 24-in. Footing (see Figure 12.25)

$$q_{\rm e} = 4000 \; {\rm psf} - \left(\frac{24 \; {\rm in.}}{12 \; {\rm in/ft}}\right) (145 \; {\rm pcf}) - \left(\frac{36 \; {\rm in.}}{12 \; {\rm in/ft}}\right) (100 \; {\rm pcf}) = 3410 \; {\rm psf}$$
 Width required =  $\frac{18 \; {\rm k}}{3.41 \; {\rm k/ft}} = 5.28 \; {\rm ft}$ 

**Bearing Pressure for Strength Design** 

$$q_u = \frac{(1.2)(12 \text{ k/ft}) + (1.6)(6 \text{ k/ft})}{5.5 \text{ ft}} = 4.36 \text{ ksf}$$

Checking Bending Strength, Neglecting Bottom 2 in. of Footing (Figure 12.25)

$$M_u$$
 for 12 in. width of footing = (4.36 klf) (2.25 ft)  $\left(\frac{2.25 \text{ ft}}{2}\right)$  = 11.04 ft-k

$$S = \frac{bd^2}{6} = \frac{(12 \text{ in.})(22 \text{ in.})^2}{6} = 968 \text{ in.}^3$$

$$\phi M_n = \phi 5 \sqrt{f_c'} S = (0.60)(5)(\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi})(968 \text{ in.}^3)$$

$$= 159,058 \text{ in-lb} = 13.25 \text{ ft-k}$$

$$> 11.04 \text{ ft-k} \qquad \underline{OK}$$

![](_page_404_Figure_14.jpeg)

**FIGURE 12.25** Plain concrete footing for Example 12.10.

#### Checking Shearing Strength at a Distance 22 in. from Face of Wall

$$\begin{split} V_u &\text{ for 12 in. width of footing} = \left(2.25 \text{ ft} - \frac{22 \text{ in.}}{12 \text{ in/ft}}\right) (4.36 \text{ klf}) = 1.82 \text{ k} \\ V_u &= \phi\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \lambda \sqrt{f_c} b h = (0.60) \left(\frac{4}{3}\right) (1.0) \left(\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}\right) (12 \text{ in.}) (22 \text{ in.}) \\ &= 11,568 \text{ lb} = 11.57 \text{ k} > 1.82 \text{ k} \quad \underline{OK} \end{split}$$

Use 24-in. footing

Note: A 23-in.-deep footing will work in this case, and a 22-in.-deep footing will almost work (within 1% moment capacity). The authors prefer to use the 24-in. depth for simplicity in this case.

#### 12.15 SI Example

#### Example 12.11

Design a reinforced concrete wall footing to support a 300-mm-wide reinforced concrete wall with a dead load D = 300 kN/m and a live load L = 200 kN/m. The bottom of the footing is to be 1 m below the final grade, the soil weight is 16 kN/m³, the concrete weight is 24 kN/m<sup>3</sup>, the allowable soil pressure,  $q_u$ , is 190 MPa/m<sup>2</sup>,  $f_v = 420$  MPa, and  $f_c' =$ 

#### SOLUTION

Assume 450-mm-Deep Footing (d = 360 mm)

$$q_{\rm e} = 190 \text{ MPa/m}^2 - \left(\frac{450 \text{ mm}}{1000}\right) (24 \text{ kN/m}^3) - \left(\frac{550 \text{ mm}}{1000}\right) (16 \text{ kN/m}^3)$$

$$= 170.4 \text{ kN/m}^2$$

Width required = 
$$\frac{300 \text{ kN/m} + 200 \text{ kN/m}}{170.4 \text{ kN/m}^2} = 2.93 \text{ m}$$
 Say 3.00 m

#### **Bearing Pressure for Strength Design**

$$q_u = \frac{(1.2)(300 \text{ kN/m}) + (1.6)(200 \text{ kN/m})}{3.00 \text{ m}} = 226.7 \text{ kN/m}^2$$

## Depth Required for Shear at a Distance *d* from Face of Wall for a One Meter Width (See Figure 12.26)

$$\begin{split} V_u &= \left(\frac{3.00 \text{ m}}{2} - \frac{150 \text{ mm}}{1000} - \frac{360 \text{ mm}}{1000}\right) (226.7 \text{ kN/m}) = 224.4 \text{ kN} \\ d &= \frac{6V_u}{(0.75)\lambda \left(\sqrt{f_c'}\right) (b_w)} = \frac{(6) \left(224.4 \text{ kN}\right) (10)^3}{(0.75) (1.0) \left(\sqrt{28} \text{ MPa}\right) (1000 \text{ mm})} \\ &= 339 \text{ mm} < 360 \text{ mm} \qquad \underline{\text{OK}} \end{split}$$

#### Steel Area (d = 360 mm) Taking Moments at Face of Wall

Cantilever length 
$$=$$
  $\frac{3.00 \text{ m}}{2} - \frac{150 \text{ mm}}{1000} = 1.35 \text{ m}$   $M_u = (1.35 \text{ m}) (226.7 \text{ kN/m}) \left(\frac{1.35 \text{ m}}{2}\right) = 206.58 \text{ kN/m}$   $\frac{M_u}{\phi b d^2} = \frac{206.58 \text{ kN-m} \times 10^6}{(0.9) (1000 \text{ mm}) (360 \text{ mm})^2} = 1.771$   $\rho = 0.00439 \text{ (from Appendix B, Table B.9)}$   $A_s = (0.00439) (1000 \text{ mm}) (360 \text{ mm}) = 1580 \text{ mm}^2/\text{m}$ 

Use #22 bars @ 225 mm o.c. (1720 mm<sup>2</sup>/m)

#### **Development Length**

From Table 7.1 in Chapter 7

$$\psi_t = \psi_e = \psi_s = \lambda = 1.0$$
 Assume  $c_b = \text{cover} = 90 \text{ mm} \leftarrow$  
$$c = \text{one-half c. to c. of bars} = 112.5 \text{ mm}$$

![](_page_406_Figure_10.jpeg)

FIGURE 12.26 Wall footing for Example 12.11.

Letting 
$$K_{tr} = 0$$
 
$$\frac{c_b + K_{tr}}{d_b} = \frac{90 \text{ mm} + 0}{22.2 \text{ mm}} = 4.05 > 2.50$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} = \frac{9f_y \psi_1 \psi_2 \psi_3}{10\lambda \sqrt{f_c'} \left(\frac{c_b + K_{tr}}{d_b}\right)}$$
 
$$= \frac{(9) (420 \text{ MPa}) (1.0) (1.0) (1.0)}{[10(1.0)\sqrt{28} \text{ MPa}] (2.5)} = 28.57 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\frac{\ell_d}{d_b} \frac{A_{\text{s reqd}}}{A_{\text{s furm}}} = (28.57) \left(\frac{1580 \text{ mm}^2}{1720 \text{ mm}^2}\right) = 26.24 \text{ diameters}$$
 
$$\ell_d = (26.24) (22.2 \text{ mm}) = 583 \text{ mm} < 1350 \text{ mm} - 100 \text{ mm}$$
 
$$= 1250 \text{ mm available} \qquad \underline{OK}$$

Use 450-mm footing 3 m wide with #22 bars @ 225 mm.

### **Computer Examples**

#### Example 12.12

Repeat Example 12.1, using the Excel spreadsheets provided for Chapter 12.

#### SOLUTION

Open the Chapter 12 spreadsheet and the Wall Footing worksheet. Enter values only for the cells highlighted in yellow (only in Excel spreadsheets, not the printed example), beginning on the left side of the worksheet. When entering "trial h," estimate a reasonable value. In this case, h=12 in. is the first try. Based on this assumption, d,  $q_e$ , and  $\ell_{min}$  are calculated. Look at the footing width  $\ell_{\text{min}}$  (9.86 ft), and enter a value that is more practical and slightly larger for the actual width in the next cell for  $\ell$  (10.0 ft). Now observe the values of  $d_{
m shear}$  and  $h_{
m shear}$  a few cells below. The correct theoretical answer for  $h_{\rm shear}$  lies between the trial h and  $h_{\rm shear}$ . So it is somewhere between 12 in. and 21.96 in. Split the difference, and go back to trial h with a value of trial h=16 in. The footing width can remain 10 ft, and  $h_{\rm shear}$  is now 20.34 in. Split the difference again, and enter trial h = 19 in. Now  $h_{\text{shear}} = 19.12$  in. Trial and error can be avoided by using the Goal Seek feature. In the first cycle, after trying h = 12 in., go to the cell called trial  $h-h_{
m shear}$ . Theoretically, this should be zero. Highlight this cell, go to Tools on the menu bar, and select Goal Seek from the drop-down menu. In "To value," enter 0, and in "By changing cell," enter C14. Click OK, and the status window says there is a solution. Select OK, and observe that cells C14 and C22 are now both 19.09 in. This may be faster than the trial-and-error method, but there is no need for the precision of the answer provided. Either method leads to the thickness of the footing of 20 in.

Now go to the right side of the worksheet, and enter ''select *h* = 20 in.'' The required area of reinforcing steel is calculated, and a list of possible choices of bar size and theoretical spacing is displayed. Pick the one you prefer, being sure to round the spacing down to a practical value. If #7 bars are selected, the theoretical spacing of 10.55 in. is rounded down to 10 in. (the same answer as Example 12.1).

A screenshot of the software for the first cycle with trial *h* = 12 in. is shown here.

#### Example 12.13

Repeat Example 12.2, using the Excel spreadsheets provided for Chapter 12.

#### **SOLUTION**

Open the Chapter 12 spreadsheet and the Square Footing worksheet. Enter values only for the cells highlighted in yellow, beginning on the left side of the worksheet. When entering ''trial *h*,'' estimate a reasonable value. In Example 12.2, an initial value of *h* = 24 was used. This turned out to be the correct answer, which is not usually the case. Let's pick a value of *h* = 18 in. to illustrate the use of the spreadsheet's ability to converge on the correct answer. Note that lmin is 9.02 ft, and a value of l = 9.00 ft was selected. This slightly nonconservative choice is consistent with what was done in Example 12.2. Now look at the upper right side of the worksheet under Two-way shear. A value of *h*<sup>2</sup> = 28.17 in. means the trial *h* of 18 in. isn't enough. A quick look at the One-way shear results shows *h*<sup>1</sup> = 21.32 in. Since *h*<sup>2</sup> is larger, two-way shear is more critical. The correct value of *h* is somewhere between 18 in. and 28.17 in. Go back to trial *h*, and split the difference by entering 23 in. A quick look at the required *h*<sup>2</sup> and *h*<sup>1</sup> shows this choice is acceptable for one-way shear, but not two-way, which needs *h*<sup>2</sup> = 24.14 in. Now enter a trial *h* of 24 in., and both *h*<sup>1</sup> and *h*<sup>2</sup> are exceeded, indicating *h* = 24 in. is enough for shear. You can also do this by using Goal seek as described in Example 12.12.

Go to the lower part of the worksheet, and enter 24 in. under select *h*. The required *As* in both directions is computed, and a table of possible choices is displayed. One of the choices is nine #8 bars, the same as was selected in Example 12.2.

A screenshot of the software for the last cycle with trial *h* = 24 in. is shown here.

## Retaining Walls

#### 13.1 Introduction

A retaining wall is a structure built for the purpose of holding back, or retaining or providing one-sided lateral confinement of soil or other loose material. The loose material being retained pushes against the wall, tending to overturn and slide it. Retaining walls are used in many design situations where there are abrupt changes in the ground slope. Perhaps the most obvious examples to the reader occur along highway or railroad cuts and fills. Often retaining walls are used in these locations to reduce the quantities of cut and fill as well as to reduce the right-of-way width required if the soils were allowed to assume their natural slopes. Retaining walls are used in many other locations as well, such as for bridge abutments, basement walls, and culverts.

Several different types of retaining walls are discussed in the next section, but whichever type is used, there will be three forces involved that must be brought into equilibrium: (1) the gravity loads of the concrete wall and any soil on top of the footing (the so-called *developed weight*), (2) the lateral pressure from the soil, and (3) the bearing resistance of the soil. In addition, the stresses within the structure have to be within permissible values, and the loads must be supported in a manner such that undue settlements do not occur. A retaining wall must be designed in such a way that the concrete elements that make up the wall comply with the ACI Code using, for the most part, principles already discussed in this text. In addition, the overall stability of the wall must be ensured. The wall may slide or tip over due to global instability without failure of the concrete elements.

### 13.2 Types of Retaining Walls

Retaining walls are generally classed as being gravity or cantilever types, with several variations possible. These are described in the paragraphs to follow, with reference being made to Figure 13.1.

The gravity retaining wall, shown in Figure 13.1(a), is used for walls of up to about 10 ft to 12 ft in height. It is usually constructed with plain concrete and depends completely on its own weight for stability against sliding and overturning. It is usually so massive that it is unreinforced. Tensile stresses calculated by the working-stress method are usually kept below  $1.6\sqrt{f_L'}$ . Gravity walls may also be constructed with stone or block masonry.

Semigravity retaining walls, shown in Figure 13.1(b), fall between the gravity and cantilever types (to be discussed in the next paragraph). They depend on their own weights plus the weight of some soil behind the wall to provide stability. Semigravity walls are used for approximately the same range of heights as the gravity walls and usually have some light reinforcement.

The *cantilever retaining wall* or one of its variations is the most common type of retaining wall. Such walls are generally used for heights from about 10 ft to 25 ft. In discussing retaining walls, the vertical wall is referred to as the *stem*. The outside part of the footing that is pressed down into the soil is called the *toe*, while the part that tends to be lifted is called the *heel*. These parts are indicated for the cantilever retaining wall of Figure 13.1(c). The concrete and its reinforcing are so arranged that part of the material behind the wall is used along with the

concrete weight to produce the necessary resisting moment against overturning. This resisting moment is generally referred to as the *righting moment*.

When it is necessary to construct retaining walls of greater heights than approximately 20 ft to 25 ft, the bending moments at the junction of the stem and footing become so large that the designer will, from economic necessity, have to consider other types of walls to handle the moments. This can be done by introducing vertical cross walls on the front or back of the stem. If the cross walls are behind the stem (i.e., inside the soil) and not visible, the retaining walls are called *counterfort walls*. Should the cross walls be visible (i.e., on the toe side), the walls are called *buttress walls*. These walls are illustrated in parts (d) and (e) of Figure 13.1. The stems for these walls are continuous members supported at intervals by the buttresses or counterforts. Counterforts or buttresses are usually spaced at distances approximately equal to one-half (or a little more) of the retaining wall heights.

The counterfort type is more commonly used because it is normally thought to be more attractive, as the cross walls or counterforts are not visible. Not only are the buttresses visible on the toe side, but their protrusion on the outside or toe side of the wall will use up valuable space. Nevertheless, buttresses are somewhat more efficient than counterforts because they consist of concrete that is put in compression by the overturning moments, whereas counterforts are concrete members used in a tension situation, and they need to be tied to the wall with stirrups. Occasionally, high walls are designed with both buttresses and counterforts.

Figure 13.2 presents a few other retaining wall variations. When a retaining wall is placed at a property boundary or next to an existing building, it may be necessary to use a

wall without a toe, as shown in part (a) of the figure, or without a heel, as shown in part (b). Another type of retaining wall very often encountered is the bridge abutment shown in part (c) of the figure. Abutments may very well have wing wall extensions on the sides to retain the soil in the approach area. The abutment, in addition to other loads, will have to support the end reactions from the bridge.

The use of precast retaining walls is becoming more common each year. The walls are built with some type of precast units, and the footings are probably poured in place. The results are very attractive, and the units are high-quality concrete members made under "plantcontrolled" conditions. Less site preparation is required, and the erection of the walls is much quicker than cast-in-place ones. The precast units can later be disassembled and the units used again. Other types of precast retaining walls consist of walls or sheeting actually driven into the ground before excavation. Also showing promise are *gabions*, or wire baskets of stone, used in conjunction with geotextile-reinforced embankments.

### **13.3 Drainage**

One of the most important items in designing and constructing successful retaining walls is the prevention of water accumulation behind the walls. If water is allowed to build up there, the result can be great lateral water pressure against the wall and perhaps an even worse situation in cold climates due to frost action.

The best possible backfill for a retaining wall is a well-drained and cohesionless soil. This is the condition for which the designer normally plans and designs. In addition to a granular backfill material, weep holes of 4 in. or more in diameter (the large sizes are used for easy cleaning) are placed in the walls approximately 5 ft to 10 ft on center, horizontally and vertically, as shown in Figure 13.3(a). If the backfill consists of a coarse sand, it is desirable to put a few shovels of pea gravel around the weep holes to try to prevent the sand from stopping up the holes.

Weep holes have the disadvantages that the water draining through the wall is somewhat unsightly and also may cause a softening of the soil in the area of the highest soil pressure (under the footing toe). A better method includes the use of a 6-in. or 8-in. perforated pipe in a bed of gravel running along the base of the wall, as shown in Figure 13.3(b). Unfortunately, both weep holes and drainage pipes can become clogged, with the result that increased water

pressure can occur. Manufactured drainage blankets or porous mats placed between the wall and the soil allow moisture to migrate freely to drainage systems, such as in Figure 13.3(b).

The drainage methods described in the preceding paragraphs are also quite effective for reducing frost action in colder areas. Frost action can cause very large movements of walls, not just in terms of inches but perhaps even in terms of a foot or two, and over a period of time can lead to failures. Frost action, however, can be greatly reduced if coarse, properly drained materials are placed behind the walls. The thickness of the fill material perpendicular to a wall should equal at least the depth of frost penetration in the ground in that area.

The best situation of all would be to keep the water out of the backfill altogether. Such a goal is normally impossible, but sometimes the surface of the backfill can be paved with asphalt or some other material, or perhaps a surface drain can be provided to remove the water, or it may be possible in some other manner to divert the water before it can get to the backfill.

### **13.4 Failures of Retaining Walls**

The number of failures or partial failures of retaining walls is rather alarming. The truth of the matter is that if large safety factors were not used, the situation would be even more severe. One reason for the large number of failures is the fact that designs are so often based on methods that are suitable only for certain special situations. For instance, if a wall that has a saturated clay behind it (never a good idea) is designed by a method that is suitable for a dry granular material, future trouble will be the result.

### **13.5 Lateral Pressure on Retaining Walls**

The actual pressures that occur behind retaining walls are quite difficult to estimate because of the large number of variables present. These include the kinds of backfill materials and their compactions and moisture contents, the types of materials beneath the footings, the presence or absence of surcharge, and other variables. As a result, the detailed estimation of the lateral forces applied to various retaining walls is clearly a problem in theoretical soil mechanics. For this reason, the discussion to follow is limited to a rather narrow range of cases.

If a retaining wall is constructed against a solid rock face, there will be no pressure applied to the wall by the rock. If the wall is built to retain a body of water, however, hydrostatic pressure will be applied to the wall. At any point, the pressure, *p*, will equal *wh*, where *w* is the unit weight of the water and *h* is the vertical distance from the surface of the water to the point in question.

If a wall is built to retain a soil, the soil's behavior will generally be somewhere between that of rock and water (*but as you will learn*, *the pressure caused by some soils is much higher than that caused by water*). The pressure exerted against the wall will increase, as did the water pressure, with depth but usually not as rapidly. This pressure at any depth can be estimated with the following expression:

$$p = Cwh$$

**FI GU RE 13.4** Chart for estimating pressure of backfill against retaining walls supporting backfills with plane surface.

In this equation, *w* is the unit weight of the soil, *h* is the distance from the surface to the point in question, and *C* is a constant that is dependent on the characteristics of the backfill. Unfortunately, the value of *C* can vary quite a bit, being perhaps as low as 0.3 or 0.4 for loose granular soils and perhaps as high as 0.9 or even 1.0 or more for some clay soils. Figure 13.4 presents charts that are sometimes used for estimating the vertical and horizontal pressures applied by soil backfills of up to 20-ft heights. Several different types of backfill materials are considered in the figure. Use of this chart is limited to walls not over about 20 ft high. (1) Backfill of coarse-grained soil without admixture of fine particles, very permeable, as clean sand or gravel. (2) Backfill of coarse-grained soil of low permeability because of admixture of particles of silt size. (3) Backfill of fine silty sand, granular materials with conspicuous clay content, and residual soil with stones. (4) Backfill of soft or very soft clay, organic silt, or silty clay.1

Unit weights of soils will vary roughly as follows: 90 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> to 100 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> for soft clays, 100 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> to 120 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> for stiff clays, 110 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> to 120 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> for sands, and 120 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> to 130 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> for sand and gravel mixes.

If you carefully study the second chart of Figure 13.4, you will probably be amazed to see how high lateral pressures can be, particularly for clays and silts. As an illustration, a 1-ftwide vertical strip is considered for a 15-ft-high retaining wall backfilled with soil number (4) with an assumed δ of 10◦ (6 : 1 slope). The total estimated horizontal pressure on the strip is

$$P_h = \frac{1}{2}k_h h^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) (102 \text{ psf}) (15 \text{ ft})^2 = 11,475 \text{ lb}$$

**FI GU RE 13.5** Possible sliding failure surface for a retaining wall supporting a sloping earth fill.

If a 15-ft-deep lake is assumed to be behind the same wall, the total horizontal pressure on the strip will be

$$P_h = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$$
 (15 ft) (15 ft) (62.4 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>) = 7020 lb

(only 61% as large as the estimated pressure for the soil)

For this introductory discussion, a retaining wall supporting a sloping earth fill is shown in Figure 13.5. Part of the earth behind the wall (shown by the hatched area) tends to slide along a curved surface (represented by the dashed line) and push against the retaining wall. The tendency of this soil to slide is resisted by friction along the soil underneath (called *internal friction*) and by friction along the vertical face of the retaining wall.

Internal friction is greater for a cohesive soil than for a noncohesive one, but the wetter such a soil becomes, the smaller will be its cohesiveness and, thus, the flatter the plane of rupture. The flatter the plane of rupture, the greater is the volume of earth tending to slide and push against the wall. Once again, it is clear that good drainage is of the utmost importance. Usually the designer assumes that a cohesionless granular backfill will be placed behind the walls.

Due to lateral pressure, the usual retaining wall will give or deflect a little because it is constructed of elastic materials. Furthermore, unless the wall rests on a rock foundation, it will tilt or lean a small distance away from the soil due to the compressible nature of the supporting soils. For these reasons, retaining walls are frequently constructed with a slight batter, or inclination, toward the backfill so that the deformations described are not obvious to passersby.

Under the lateral pressures described, the usual retaining wall will move a little distance and *active soil pressure* will develop, as shown in Figure 13.6. Among the many factors that affect the pressure applied to a particular wall are the kind of backfill material used, the drainage situation, the level of the water table, the seasonal conditions such as dry or wet or frozen, the presence of trucks or other equipment on the backfill, and so on.

For design purposes, it is usually satisfactory to assume that the active pressure varies linearly with the depth of the backfill. In other words, it is just as though (so far as lateral pressure is concerned) there is a liquid of some weight behind the wall that can vary from considerably less than the weight of water to considerably more. The chart of Figure 13.4 shows this large variation in possible lateral pressures. The assumed lateral pressures are often

![](_page_421_Figure_2.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 13.6** Active and passive soil pressures.

referred to as *equivalent fluid pressures. Values from 30 pcf to 50 pcf are normally assumed but may be much too low for clay and silt materials.*

If the wall moves away from the backfill and against the soil at the toe, a passive soil pressure will be the result. Passive pressure, which is also assumed to vary linearly with depth, is illustrated in Figure 13.6. The inclusion or noninclusion of passive pressure in the design calculations is a matter of judgment on the designer's part. For effective passive pressure to be developed at the toe, the toe concrete must be placed against undisturbed earth without the use of vertical forms. Even if this procedure is followed, the designer will probably reduce the height of the undisturbed soil (*h* in Figure 13.6) used in the calculations to account for some disturbance of the earth during construction operations.

As long as the backfills are granular, noncohesive, and dry, the assumption of an equivalent liquid pressure is fairly satisfactory. Formulas based on an assumption of dry sand or gravel backfills are not satisfactory for soft clays or saturated sands. Actually, clays should not be used for backfills because their shear characteristics change easily and they may tend to creep against the wall, increasing pressures as time goes by.

If a linear pressure variation is assumed, the active pressure at any depth can be determined as

$$p_a = k_a w h$$

or, for passive pressure,

$$p_p = k_p w h'$$

In these expressions, *ka* and *kp* are the approximate coefficients of active and passive pressures, respectively. These coefficients can be calculated by theoretical equations such as those of Rankine or Coulomb.2 For a granular material, typical values of *ka* and *kp* are 0.3 and 3.3. The Rankine equation (published in 1857) neglects the friction of the soil on the wall, whereas the Coulomb formula (published in 1776) takes it into consideration. These two equations were developed for cohesionless soils. For cohesive soils containing clays and/or silts, it is necessary to use empirical values determined from field measurements (such as those given in Figure 13.4).

It has been estimated that the cost of constructing retaining walls varies directly with the square of their heights. Thus, as retaining walls become higher, the accuracy of the computed

FIGURE 13.7 Active and passive soil pressures with sloping backfill.

lateral pressures becomes more and more important in providing economical designs. Since the Coulomb equation does take into account friction on the wall, it is thought to be the more accurate one and is often used for walls of over 20 ft. The Rankine equation is commonly used for ordinary retaining walls of 20 ft or less in height. It is interesting to note that the two methods give identical results if the friction of the soil on the wall is neglected.

The Rankine expressions for the active and passive pressure coefficients are given at the end of this paragraph with reference to Figure 13.7. In these expressions,  $\delta$  is the angle the backfill makes with the horizontal, while  $\phi$  is the angle of internal friction of the soil. For well-drained sand or gravel backfills, the angle of internal friction is often taken as the angle of repose of the slope. One common slope used is 1 vertically to  $1\frac{1}{2}$  horizontally  $(33^{\circ}40')$ .

$$k_a = \cos \delta \left( \frac{\cos \delta - \sqrt{\cos^2 \delta - \cos^2 \phi}}{\cos \delta + \sqrt{\cos^2 \delta - \cos^2 \phi}} \right)$$

$$k_p = \cos \delta \left( \frac{\cos \delta + \sqrt{\cos^2 \delta - \cos^2 \phi}}{\cos \delta - \sqrt{\cos^2 \delta - \cos^2 \phi}} \right)$$

Should the backfill be horizontal—that is, should  $\delta$  be equal to zero—the expressions become

$$k_a = \frac{1 - \sin \phi}{1 + \sin \phi}$$

$$k_p = \frac{1 + \sin \phi}{1 - \sin \phi}$$

One trouble with using these expressions is in the determination of  $\phi$ . It can be as small as  $0^{\circ}$  to  $10^{\circ}$  for soft clays and as high as  $30^{\circ}$  or  $40^{\circ}$  for some granular materials. As a result, the values of  $k_a$  can vary from perhaps 0.30 for some granular materials up to about 1.0 for some wet clays.

Once the values of  $k_a$  and  $k_p$  are determined, the total horizontal pressures,  $H_a$  and  $H_p$ , can be calculated as being equal to the areas of the respective triangular pressure diagrams. For instance, with reference to Figure 13.7, the value of the active pressure is

$$H_a = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(p_a)(h) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(k_a w h)(h)$$

$$H_a = \frac{k_a w h^2}{2}$$

and, similarly,

$$H_p = \frac{k_p w h'^2}{2}$$

In addition to these lateral pressures applied to the retaining wall, it is considered necessary in many parts of the country to add the effect of frost action at the top of the stem—perhaps as much as 600 lb or 700 lb per linear foot in areas experiencing extreme weather conditions.

### **Footing Soil Pressures**

Because of lateral forces, the resultant of the horizontal and vertical forces, R, intersects the soil underneath the footing as an eccentric load, causing greater pressure at the toe. This toe pressure should be less than the permissible value,  $q_a$ , of the particular soil. It is also desirable to keep the resultant force within the kern or the middle third of the footing base.

If the resultant force intersects the soil within the middle third of the footing, the soil pressure at any point can be calculated with the formula to follow exactly as the stresses are determined in an eccentrically loaded column.

$$q = -\frac{R_v}{A} \pm \frac{R_v ec}{I}$$

In this expression,  $R_v$  is the vertical component of R or the total vertical load, e is the eccentricity of the load from the center of the footing, A is the area of a 1-ft-wide strip of soil of a length equal to the width of the footing base, and I is the moment of inertia of the same area about its centroid. This expression is correct only if  $R_{\nu}$  falls within the kern.

This expression can be reduced to the following expression, in which L is the width of the footing from heel to toe.

$$q = -\frac{R_v}{L} \pm \frac{R_v e(L/2)}{L^3/12} = -\frac{R_v}{L} \left( 1 \pm \frac{6e}{L} \right)$$

If the resultant force falls outside of the middle third of the footing, the preceding expressions are not applicable because they indicate a tensile stress on one side of the footing—a

stress the soil cannot supply. For such cases, the soil pressures can be determined as previously described in Section 12.12 and Figure 12.24 in Chapter 12. Such a situation should not be permitted in a retaining wall and is not considered further.

The soil pressures computed in this manner are only rough estimates of the real values and, thus, should not be valued too highly. The true pressures are appreciably affected by quite a few items other than the retaining wall weight. Included are drainage conditions, temperature, settlement, pore water, and so on.

### 13.7 Design of Semigravity Retaining Walls

As previously mentioned, semigravity retaining walls are designed to resist earth pressure by means of their own weight plus some developed soil weight. Because they are normally constructed with plain concrete, stone, or perhaps some other type of masonry, their design is based on the assumption that only very little tension or none at all can be permitted in the structure. If the resultant of the earth pressure and the wall weight (including any developed soil weight) falls within the middle third of the wall base, tensile stresses will probably be negligible.

A wall size is assumed, safety factors against sliding and overturning are calculated, the point where the resultant force strikes the base is determined, and the soil pressures are calculated. It is normally felt that safety factors against sliding should be at least 1.5 for cohesionless backfills and 2.0 for cohesive ones. Safety factors of 2.0 for overturning are normally specified. A suitable wall is probably obtained after two or three trial sizes. Example 13.1 illustrates the calculations that need to be made for each trial.

Figure 13.8(a) shows a set of approximate dimensions that are often used for sizing semigravity walls. Dimensions may be assumed to be approximately equal to the values given and the safety factors against overturning and sliding computed. If the values are not suitable, the dimensions are adjusted and the safety factors are recalculated, and so on. Semigravity walls are normally trapezoidal in shape, as shown in Figure 13.8(a), but sometimes they may have broken backs, as illustrated in Figure 13.8(b).

### Example 13.1

A semigravity retaining wall consisting of plain concrete (weight = 145 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>) is shown in Figure 13.9. The bank of supported earth is assumed to weigh 110 lb/ft<sup>3</sup>, to have a  $\phi$  of 30°, and to have a coefficient of friction against sliding on soil of 0.5. Determine the safety factors against overturning and sliding and determine the bearing pressure underneath the toe of the footing. Use the Rankine expression for calculating the horizontal pressures.

#### SOLUTION

#### **Computing the Soil Pressure Coefficients**

$$k_a = \frac{1 - \sin \phi}{1 + \sin \phi} = \frac{1 - 0.5}{1 + 0.5} = 0.333$$

$$k_p = \frac{1 + \sin \phi}{1 - \sin \phi} = \frac{1 + 0.5}{1 - 0.5} = 3.00$$

Value of H<sub>a</sub>

$$H_a = \frac{k_a w h^2}{2} = \frac{(0.333) (110 \text{ pcf}) (12 \text{ ft})^2}{2} = 2637 \text{ lb/ft}$$

#### **Overturning Moment**

O.T.M. = 
$$(2637 \text{ lb/ft}) \left(\frac{12 \text{ ft}}{3}\right) = 10,548 \text{ ft-lb/ft}$$

Safety factor = 
$$\frac{36,484 \text{ ft-lb}}{10,548 \text{ ft-lb}} = 3.46 > 2.00$$
 OK

#### Safety Factor Against Sliding (Also Discussed at Length in Section 13.10)

Assuming soil above the footing toe has eroded, and thus the passive pressure is due only to soil of a depth equal to footing thickness,

$$H_p = \frac{k_p w h'^2}{2} = \frac{(3.0) (110 \text{ pcf}) (1 \text{ ft})^2}{2} = 165 \text{ lb}$$

#### **Distance of Resultant from Toe**

$$\frac{36,484 \text{ ft-lb} - 10,548 \text{ ft-lb}}{10,228 \text{ lb}} = 2.54 \text{ ft} > 2.33 \text{ ft}$$

$$I = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (1 \text{ ft}) (7 \text{ ft})^3 = 28.58 \text{ ft}^4$$

$$f_{\text{toe}} = -\frac{R_v}{A} - \frac{R_v \text{ec}}{I} = -\frac{10,228 \text{ lb}}{7.0 \text{ ft}^2} - \frac{(10,228 \text{ lb}) (3.50 \text{ ft} - 2.54 \text{ ft}) (3.50 \text{ ft})}{28.58 \text{ ft}^4}$$

$$= -1461 \text{ psf} - 1202 \text{ psf} = -2663 \text{ psf}$$

$$f_{\text{heel}} = -\frac{R_v}{A} + \frac{R_v \text{ec}}{I} = -1461 \text{ psf} + 1202 \text{ psf} = -259 \text{ psf}$$

### **13.8 Effect of Surcharge**

Should there be earth or other loads on the surface of the backfill, as shown in Figure 13.10, the horizontal pressure applied to the wall will be increased. If the surcharge is uniform over the sliding area behind the wall, the resulting pressure is assumed to equal the pressure that would be caused by an increased backfill height having the same total weight as the surcharge. It is usually easy to handle this situation by adding a uniform pressure to the triangular soil pressure for a wall without surcharge, as shown in the figure.

If the surcharge does not cover the area entirely behind the wall, some rather complex soil theories are available to consider the resulting horizontal pressures developed. As a consequence, the designer usually uses a rule of thumb to cover the case, a procedure that works reasonably well.

He or she may assume, as shown in Figure 13.11, that the surcharge cannot affect the pressure above the intersection of a 45◦ line from the edge of the surcharge to the wall. The lateral pressure is increased, as by a full surcharge, below the intersection point. This is shown on the right side of the figure.

### **13.9 Estimating the Sizes of Cantilever Retaining Walls**

The statical analysis of retaining walls and consideration of their stability as to overturning and sliding are based on service-load conditions. In other words, the length of the footing and the position of the stem on the footing are based entirely on the actual soil backfill, estimated lateral pressure, coefficient of sliding friction of the soil, and so on.

On the other hand, the detailed designs of the stem and footing and their reinforcing are determined by the strength design method. To carry out these calculations, it is necessary to multiply the service loads and pressures by the appropriate load factors. From these factored loads, the bearing pressures, moments, and shears are determined for use in the design.

Thus, the initial part of the design consists of an approximate sizing of the retaining wall. Although this is actually a trial-and-error procedure, the values obtained are not too sensitive to slightly incorrect values, and usually one or two trials are sufficient.

Various rules of thumb are available with which excellent initial size estimates can be made. In addition, various handbooks present the final sizes of retaining walls that have been designed for certain specific cases. This information will enable the designer to estimate very well the proportions of a wall to be designed. The *CRSI Design Handbook* is one such useful reference.3 In the next few paragraphs, suggested methods are presented for estimating sizes without the use of a handbook. These approximate methods are very satisfactory as long as the conditions are not too much out of the ordinary.

### **Height of Wall**

The necessary elevation at the top of the wall is normally obvious from the conditions of the problem. The elevation at the base of the footing should be selected so that it is below frost penetration in the particular area—about 3 ft to 6 ft below ground level in the northern part of the United States. From these elevations, the overall height of the wall can be determined.

### **Stem Thickness**

Stems are theoretically thickest at their bases because the shears and moments are greatest there. They will ordinarily have total thicknesses somewhere in the range of 7% to 12% of the overall heights of the retaining walls. The shears and moments in the stem decrease from the bottom to the top; as a result, thicknesses and reinforcement can be reduced proportionately. Stems are normally tapered, as shown in Figure 13.12. The minimum thickness at the top of the stem is 8 in., with 12 in. preferable. As will be shown in Section 13.10, it is necessary to have a mat of reinforcing in the inside face of the stem and another mat in the outside face.

![](_page_428_Picture_11.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 13.12** Cantilever retaining wall with tapered stem.

<sup>3</sup> Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, 2008, *CRSI Design Handbook*, 10th ed. (Chicago, IL: CRSI), pp. 14-1 to 14-46.

To provide room for these two mats of reinforcing, for cover and spacing between the mats, a minimum total thickness of at least 8 in. is required.

The use of the minimum thickness possible for walls that are primarily reinforced in one direction (here it's the vertical bars) doesn't necessarily provide the best economy. The reason is that the reinforcing steel is a major part of the total cost. Making the walls as thin as possible will save some concrete but will substantially increase the amount of reinforcing needed. For fairly high and heavily loaded walls, greater thicknesses of concrete may be economical.

If  $\rho$  in the stem is limited to a maximum value of approximately  $(0.18f'_c/f_v)$ , the stem thickness required for moment will probably provide sufficient shear resistance without using stirrups. Furthermore, it will probably be sufficiently thick to limit lateral deflections to reasonable values.

For heights up to about 12 ft, the stems of cantilever retaining walls are normally made of constant thickness because the extra cost of setting the tapered formwork is usually not offset by the savings in concrete. Above 12-ft heights, concrete savings are usually sufficiently large to make tapering economical.

Actually, the sloping face of the wall can be either the front or the back, but if the outside face is tapered, it will tend to counteract somewhat the deflection and tilting of the wall because of lateral pressures. A taper or batter of  $\frac{1}{4}$  in. per foot of height is often recommended to offset deflection or the forward tilting of the wall.

#### **Base Thickness**

The final thickness of the base will be determined on the basis of shears and moments. For estimating, however, its total thickness will probably fall somewhere between 7% and 10% of the overall wall height. Minimum thicknesses of at least 10 in. to 12 in. are used.

#### **Base Length**

For preliminary estimates, the base length can be taken to be about 40% to 60% of the overall wall height. A little better estimate, however, can be made by using the method described by the late Professor Ferguson in his reinforced concrete text.<sup>4</sup> For this discussion, reference is made to Figure 13.13. In this figure, W is assumed to equal the weight of all the material within area abcd. This area contains both concrete and soil, but the authors assume here that it is all soil. This means that a slightly larger safety factor will be developed against overturning

than assumed. When surcharge is present, it will be included as an additional depth of soil, as shown in the figure.

If the sum of moments about point *a* due to *W* and the lateral forces *H*<sup>1</sup> and *H*<sup>2</sup> equal zero, the resultant force, *R*, will pass through point *a*. Such a moment equation can be written, equated to zero, and solved for *x*. Should the distance from the footing toe to point *a* be equal to one-half of the distance *x* in the figure and the resultant force, *R*, pass through point *a*, the footing pressure diagram will be triangular. In addition, if moments are taken about the toe of all the loads and forces for the conditions described, the safety factor against overturning will be approximately two.

A summary of the preceding approximate first trial sizes for cantilever retaining walls is shown in Figure 13.14. These sizes are based on the dimensions of walls successfully constructed in the past. They often will be on the conservative side.

#### Example 13.2

Using the approximate rules presented in this section, estimate the sizes of the parts of the retaining wall shown in Figure 13.15. The soil weighs 100 lb/ft3, and a surcharge of 300 psf is present. Assume *ka* = 0.32. (For many practical soils such as clays or silts, *ka* will be two or more times this large.)

#### **SOLUTION**

#### **Stem Thickness**

Assume 12 in. thickness at top.

Assume bottom thickness = 
$$0.07h = (0.07)(21 \text{ ft}) = 1.47 \text{ ft}$$
 Say 1 ft 6 in.

#### **Base Thickness**

Assume base *t* = 7% to 10% of overall wall height.

$$t = (0.07) (21 \text{ ft}) = 1.47 \text{ ft}$$
 Say 1 ft 6 in.

Height of stem = 21 ft 0 in. 
$$-1$$
 ft 6 in.  $=$   $\underline{19}$  ft 6 in.

The final trial dimensions are shown in Figure 13.22.

### **13.10 Design Procedure for Cantilever Retaining Walls**

This section is presented to describe in some detail the procedure used for designing a cantilever retaining wall. At the end of this section, the complete design of such a wall is presented. Once the approximate size of the wall has been established, the stem, toe, and heel can be designed in detail. Each of these parts will be designed individually as a cantilever sticking out of a central mass, as shown in Figure 13.17.

### **Stem**

The values of shear and moment at the base of the stem resulting from lateral earth pressures are computed and used to determine the stem thickness and necessary reinforcing. Because the lateral pressures are considered to be live load forces, a load factor of 1.6 is used.

It will be noted that the bending moment requires the use of vertical reinforcing bars on the soil side of the stem. In addition, temperature and shrinkage reinforcing must be provided. In Section 14.3 of the ACI Code, a minimum value of horizontal reinforcing equal to 0.0025

![](_page_432_Figure_11.jpeg)

**FI GU RE 13.17** Cantilever beam model used to design retaining wall stem, heel, and toe.

of the area of the wall, bt, is required as well as a minimum amount of vertical reinforcing (0.0015). These values may be reduced to 0.0020 and 0.0012 if the reinforcing is  $\frac{5}{8}$  in. or less in diameter and if it consists of bars or welded wire fabric (not larger than W31 or D31), with  $f_{y}$  equal to or greater than 60,000 psi.

The major changes in temperature occur on the front or exposed face of the stem. For this reason, most of the horizontal reinforcing (perhaps two-thirds) should be placed on that face with just enough vertical steel used to support the horizontal bars. The concrete for a retaining wall should be placed in fairly short lengths—not greater than 20-ft or 30-ft sections—to reduce shrinkage stresses.

#### **Factor of Safety Against Overturning**

Moments are taken about the toe of the unfactored overturning and righting forces. Traditionally, it has been felt that the safety factor against overturning should be at least equal to 2. In making these calculations, backfill on the toe is usually neglected because it may very well be eroded. Of course, there are cases where there is a slab (e.g., a highway pavement on top of the toe backfill) that holds the backfill in place over the toe. For such situations, it may be reasonable to include the loads on the toe.

#### **Factor of Safety Against Sliding**

Consideration of sliding for retaining walls is a most important topic because a very large percentage of retaining wall failures occur because of sliding. To calculate the factor of safety against sliding, the estimated sliding resistance (equal to the coefficient of friction for concrete on soil times the resultant vertical force,  $\mu R_{\nu}$ ) is divided by the total horizontal force. The passive pressure against the wall is neglected, and the unfactored loads are used.

Typical design values of  $\mu$ , the coefficient of friction between the footing concrete and the supporting soil, are as follows: 0.45 to 0.55 for coarse-grained soils, with the lower value applying if some silt is present, and 0.6 if the footing is supported on sound rock with a rough surface. Values of 0.3 to 0.35 are used if the supporting material is silt.

It is usually felt that the factor of safety against sliding should be at least equal to 1.5. When retaining walls are initially designed, the calculated factor of safety against sliding is very often considerably less than this value. To correct the situation, the most common practice is to widen the footing on the heel side. Another practice is to use a lug or key, as shown in Figure 13.18, with the front face cast directly against undisturbed soil. (Many designers feel

![](_page_433_Picture_10.jpeg)

FIGURE 13.18 Passive pressure in a lug.

that the construction of keys disturbs the soil so much that they are not worthwhile.) Keys are thought to be particularly necessary for moist clayey soils. The purpose of a key is to cause the development of passive pressure in front of and below the base of the footing, as shown by *Pp* in the figure. The actual theory involved, and thus the design of keys, is still a question among geotechnical engineers. As a result, many designers select the sizes of keys by rules of thumb. One common practice is to give them a depth between two-thirds and the full depth of the footing. They are usually made approximately square in cross section and have no reinforcing provided other than perhaps the dowels mentioned in the next paragraph.

Keys are often located below the stem so that some dowels or extended vertical reinforcing may be extended into them. If this procedure is used, the front face of the key needs to be at least 5 in. or 6 in. in front of the back face of the stem to allow room for the dowels. From a soil mechanics view, keys may be a little more effective if they are placed a little farther toward the heel.

If the key can be extended down into a very firm soil or even rock, the result will be a greatly increased sliding resistance—that resistance being equal to the force necessary to shear the key off from the footing, that is, a shear friction calculated as described in Sections 8.12 and 12.13 of this text.

#### **Heel Design**

Lateral earth pressure tends to cause the retaining wall to rotate about its toe. This action tends to pick up the heel into the backfill. The backfill pushes down on the heel cantilever, causing tension in its top. The major force applied to the heel of a retaining wall is the downward weight of the backfill behind the wall. Although it is true that there is some upward soil pressure, many designers choose to neglect it because it is relatively small. The downward loads tend to push the heel of the footing down, and the necessary upward reaction to hold it attached to the stem is provided by the vertical tensile steel in the stem, which is extended down into the footing.

Because the reaction in the direction of the shear does not introduce compression into the heel part of the footing in the region of the stem, it is not permissible to determine  $V_{\mu}$  at a distance d from the face of the stem, as provided in Section 11.1.3.1 of the ACI Code. The value of  $V_n$  is determined instead at the face of the stem because of the downward loads. This shear is often of such magnitude as to control the thickness, but the moment at the face of the stem should be checked also. Because the load here consists of soil and concrete, a load factor of 1.2 is used for making the calculations.

It will be noted that the bars in the heel will be in the top of the footing. As a result, the required development length of these "top bars" may be rather large.

The percentage of flexural steel required for the heel frequently is less than the  $\rho_{\min}$  of  $200/f_{\rm v}$  and  $3\sqrt{f_{\rm c}'}/f_{\rm v}$ . Despite the fact that the ACI Code (10.5.4) exempts slabs of uniform from these  $\rho_{\min}$  values, the authors recommend that these be used because the retaining wall is a major beamlike structure.

#### Toe Design

The toe is assumed to be a beam cantilevered from the front face of the stem. The loads it must support include the weight of the cantilever slab and the upward soil pressure beneath. Usually any earth fill on top of the toe is neglected (as though it has been eroded). Obviously, such a fill would increase the upward soil pressure beneath the footing, but because it acts downward and cancels out the upward pressure, it produces no appreciable changes in the shears and moments in the toe.

A study of Figure 13.19 shows that the upward soil pressure is the major force applied to the toe. Because this pressure is primarily caused by the lateral force H, a load factor of 1.6 is used for the calculations. (Section 4.1 of this text shows that all load combinations including soil loads have a load factor of 1.6 associated with H.) The maximum moment for design is taken at the face of the stem, whereas the maximum shear for design is assumed to occur at

FIGURE 13.19 Assumed soil stress distribution at the base

FIGURE 13.20 Keyway for improved shear capacity.

a distance d from the face of the stem because the reaction in the direction of the shear does introduce compression into the toe of the footing. The average designer makes the thickness of the toe the same as the thickness of the heel, although such a practice is not essential.

It is a common practice in retaining wall construction to provide a shear keyway between the base of the stem and the footing. This practice, though definitely not detrimental, is of questionable value. The keyway is normally formed by pushing a beveled 2 in.  $\times$  4 in. or 2 in.  $\times$  6 in. into the top of the footing, as shown in Figure 13.20. After the concrete hardens, the wood member is removed, and when the stem is cast in place above, a keyway is formed. It is becoming more and more common simply to use a roughened surface on the top of the footing where the stem will be placed. This practice seems to be just as satisfactory as the use of a keyway.

In Example 13.3, #8 bars 6 in. on center are selected for the vertical steel at the base of the stem. These bars need to be embedded into the footing for development purposes, or dowels equal to the stem steel need to be used for the transfer. This latter practice is quite common because it is rather difficult to hold the stem steel in position while the base concrete is placed.

The required development length of the #8 bars down into the footing or for #8 dowels is 33 in. when  $f_y = 60,000$  psi and  $f_c' = 3000$  psi. This length cannot be obtained vertically in the 1-ft-6-in. footing used unless the bars or dowels are either bent as shown in Figure 13.21(a) or extended through the footing and into the base key as shown in Figure 13.21(b). Actually, the required development length can be reduced if more but smaller dowels are used. For #6 dowels,  $\ell_d$  is 20 in.

FIGURE 13.21 Bar development options.

If instead of dowels the vertical stem bars are embedded into the footing, they should not extend up into the wall more than 8 ft or 10 ft before they are spliced because they are difficult to handle in construction and may easily be bent out of place or even broken. Actually, after examining Figure 13.21(a), you can see that such an arrangement of stem steel can sometimes be very advantageous economically.

The bending moment in the stem decreases rapidly above the base; as a result, the amount of reinforcing can be similarly reduced. It is to be remembered that these bars can be cut off only in accordance with the ACI Code development length requirements.

Example 13.3 illustrates the detailed design of a cantilever retaining wall. Several important descriptive remarks are presented in the solution, and these should be carefully read.

#### Example 13.3

Complete the design of the cantilever retaining wall whose dimensions were estimated in Example 13.2 and are shown in Figure 13.22 if  $f'_c = 3000$  psi,  $f_v = 60,000$  psi,  $q_a = 4000$  psf, and the coefficient of sliding friction equals 0.50 for concrete on soil. Use  $\rho$  approximately equal to  $0.18f'_{c}/f_{v}$  to maintain reasonable deflection control.

#### SOLUTION

The safety factors against overturning and sliding and the soil pressures under the heel and toe are computed using the actual unfactored loads.

Safety factor against overturning = 
$$\frac{149,456 \text{ ft-lb}}{70,560 \text{ ft-lb}} = 2.12 > 2.00$$
 OK

<sup>\*</sup> Includes surcharge.

#### **Factor of Safety Against Sliding**

Here the passive pressure against the wall is neglected. Normally it is felt that the factor of safety should be at least 1.5. If it is not satisfactory, a little wider footing on the heel side will easily take care of the situation. In addition to or instead of this solution, a key, perhaps 1 ft 6 in. x 1 ft 6 in. (size selected to provide sufficient development length for the dowels selected later in this design) can be used. Space is not taken here to improve this safety factor.

Force causing sliding = 
$$H_1 + H_2 = 9072$$
 lb

Resisting force =  $\mu R_v = (0.50) (20,306$  lb) = 10,153 lb

Safety factor =  $\frac{10,153}{9072} \frac{\text{No good}}{\text{lb}} = 1.12 < 1.50$ 

No good

#### **Footing Soil Pressures**

 $R_v = 20{,}306$  lb and is located a distance  $\overline{x}$  from the toe of the footing

$$\overline{x} = \frac{149,456 \text{ ft-lb} - 70,560 \text{ ft-lb}}{20,306 \text{ lb}} = \frac{78,896 \text{ ft-lb}}{20,306 \text{ lb}} = 3.89 \text{ ft}$$

$$Soil \text{ pressure} = -\frac{R_v}{A} \pm \frac{Mc}{I}$$

$$A = (1 \text{ ft}) (11.5 \text{ ft}) = 11.5 \text{ ft}^2$$

$$I = \left(\frac{1}{12}\right) (1 \text{ ft}) (11.5 \text{ ft})^3 = 126.74 \text{ ft}^4$$

$$f_{\text{toe}} = -\frac{20,306 \text{ lb}}{11.5 \text{ ft}^2} - \frac{(20,306 \text{ lb}) (5.75 \text{ ft} - 3.89 \text{ ft}) (5.75 \text{ ft})}{126.74 \text{ ft}^4}$$

$$= -1766 \text{ psf} - 1714 \text{ psf} = -3480 \text{ psf}$$

$$f_{\text{heel}} = -1766 \text{ psf} + 1714 \text{ psf} = -52 \text{ psf}$$

#### **Design of Stem**

The lateral forces applied to the stem are calculated using a load factor of 1.6, as shown in Figure 13.24.

#### **Design of Stem for Moment**

$$M_u = (H_1) (6.50 \text{ ft}) + (H_2) (9.75 \text{ ft}) = (9734 \text{ lb}) (6.50 \text{ ft}) + (2995 \text{ lb}) (9.75 \text{ ft})$$
  
 $M_u = 92,472 \text{ ft-lb}$ 

Use

$$\rho = \text{approximately } \frac{0.18f_c'}{f_y} = \frac{(0.18)\,(3000\,\text{psi})}{60,000\,\text{psi}} = 0.009$$
 
$$\frac{M_u}{\phi b d^2} = 482.6\,\text{psi (from Appendix A, Table A.12)}$$
 
$$b d^2 = \frac{(12\,\text{in/ft})\,(92,472\,\text{ft-lb})}{(0.9)\,(482.6\,\text{psi})} = 2555\,\text{in.}^3$$
 
$$d = \sqrt{\frac{2555\,\text{in.}^3}{12\,\text{in.}}} = 14.59\,\text{in.}$$
 
$$h = 14.59\,\text{in.} + 2\,\text{in.} + \frac{1\,\text{in.}}{2} = 17.09\,\text{in.}$$
 Say 18 in.  $(d = 15.50\,\text{in.})$

FIGURE 13.24 Lateral forces from backfill and surcharge.

$$\frac{M_u}{\phi b d^2} = \frac{(12 \text{ in/ft}) (92,472 \text{ ft-lb})}{(0.90) (12 \text{ in.}) (15.5 \text{ in.})^2} = 427.7 \text{ psi}$$

$$\rho = 0.00786 \text{ (from Appendix A, Table A.12)}$$

$$A_s = (0.00786) (12 \text{ in.}) (15.5 \text{ in.}) = 1.46 \text{ in.}^2$$

(say one-third inside face and two-thirds outside face)

Use #4 @  $7\frac{1}{2}$  in. outside face and #4 @ 15 in. inside face

#### **Checking Shear Stress in Stem**

Actually,  $V_{ij}$  at a distance d from the top of the footing can be used, but for simplicity:

$$V_u=H_1+H_2=9734\ \mathrm{lb}+2995\ \mathrm{lb}=12,729\ \mathrm{lb}$$
 
$$\phi V_c=\phi 2\lambda \sqrt{f_c'}bd=(0.75)\ (2)\ (1.0)\ (\sqrt{3000}\ \mathrm{psi})\ (12\ \mathrm{in.})\ (15.5\ \mathrm{in.})$$
 
$$=15,281\ \mathrm{lb}>12,729\ \mathrm{lb}\qquad \underline{\mathrm{OK}}$$

#### **Design of Heel**

The upward soil pressure is conservatively neglected, and a load factor of 1.2 is used for calculating the shear and moment because soil and concrete make up the load.

$$V_u = (22.5 \text{ ft}) (6.25 \text{ ft}) (100 \text{ pcf}) (1.2) + (1.5 \text{ ft}) (6.25 \text{ ft}) (150 \text{ pcf}) (1.2) = 18,563 \text{ lb/ft}$$
 
$$\phi V_c = (0.75) (2) (1.0) (\sqrt{3000} \text{ psi}) (12 \text{ in.}) (14.5 \text{ in.}) = 14,295 \text{ lb} < 18,563 \text{ lb}$$
 No good

Neglecting slight change in  $V_{ij}$  with different depth

$$\begin{split} \phi V_c &= (0.75)\,(2)\,(1.0)\,(\sqrt{3000}\;\text{psi})\,(12\;\text{in.})\,(20.5\;\text{in.}) \\ &= 20,\!211\;\text{lb} > 18,\!563\;\text{lb} \qquad \underline{OK} \\ \\ M_u \;\text{at face of stem} &= (18,\!563\;\text{lb})\,\bigg(\frac{6.25\;\text{ft}}{2}\bigg) = 58,\!009\;\text{ft-lb} \\ \\ \frac{M_u}{\phi b d^2} &= \frac{(12\;\text{in/ft})\,(58,\!009\;\text{ft-lb})}{(0.9)\,(12\;\text{in.})\,(20.5\;\text{in.})^2} = 153\;\text{psi} \\ \\ \rho &= \rho_{\text{min}} \end{split}$$

Using  $\rho = 0.00333$ ,

$$A_x = (0.00333) (12 \text{ in.}) (20.5 \text{ in.}) = 0.82 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$$
 Use #8 @ 11 in

 $\ell_d$  required calculated with ACI Equation 12-1 for #8 top bars with c=2.50 in. and  $K_{tr}=0$  is 43 in. < 72 in. available.

Heel reinforcing is shown in Figure 13.25.

Note: Temperature and shrinkage steel is normally considered unnecessary in the heel and toe. However, the authors have placed #4 bars at 18 in. on center in the long direction, as shown in Figures 13.25 and 13.27, to serve as spacers for the flexural steel and to form mats out of the reinforcing.

#### **Design of Toe**

For service loads, the soil pressures previously determined are multiplied by a load factor of 1.6 because they are primarily caused by the lateral forces, as shown in Figure 13.26.

$$V_{ii} = 10,440 \text{ lb} + 7086 \text{ lb} = 17,526 \text{ lb}$$

(The shear can be calculated a distance d from the face of the stem because the reaction in the direction of the shear does introduce compression into the toe of the slab, but this advantage

![](_page_442_Figure_2.jpeg)

FIGURE 13.26 Soil reactions.

is neglected because 17,526 lb is already less than the 19,125 lb shear in the heel, which was satisfactory.)

$$\begin{split} \textit{M}_{\textit{u}} \text{ at face of stem} &= (7086 \text{ lb}) \left( \frac{3.75 \text{ ft}}{3} \right) + (10,440 \text{ lb}) \left( \frac{2}{3} \times 3.75 \text{ ft} \right) = 34,958 \text{ ft-lb} \\ \frac{\textit{M}_{\textit{u}}}{\phi \textit{bd}^2} &= \frac{(12 \text{ in/ft}) (34,958 \text{ ft-lb})}{(0.9) (12 \text{ in.}) (20.5 \text{ in.})^2} = 92 \text{ psi} \\ \rho &= \text{less than } \rho_{\text{min}} \end{split}$$

Therefore, use

$$\frac{200}{60,000 \text{ psi}} = 0.00333$$
 
$$A_s = (0.00333) (12 \text{ in.}) (20.5 \text{ in.}) = 0.82 \text{ in}^2/\text{ft}$$
 Use #8 @ 11 in.

 $\ell_d$  required calculated with ACI Equation 12-1 for #8 bottom bars with c=2.50 in. and  $K_{tr}=0$  equals 33 in. < 42 in. available. <u>OK</u>

**TABLE 13.1** Stem Design for Example 13.3

#### **Selection of Dowels and Lengths of Vertical Stem Reinforcing**

The detailed selection of vertical bar lengths in the stem is omitted here to save space, and only a few general comments are presented. Table 13.1 shows the reduced bending moments up in the stem and the corresponding reductions in reinforcing required.

After considering the possible arrangements of the steel in Figure 13.21 and the required areas of steel at different elevations in Table 13.1, the authors decided to use dowels for load transfer at the stem base.

#### Use #8 dowels at 6 in. extending 33 in. down into footing and key.

If these dowels are spliced to the vertical stem reinforcing with no more than onehalf the bars being spliced within the required lap length, the splices will fall into the class B category (ACI Code 12.15), and their lap length should at least equal 1.3l*<sup>d</sup>* = (1.3) (33) = 43 in. Therefore, two dowel lengths are used—half 3 ft 7 in. up into the stem and the other half 7 ft 2 in.—and the #7 bars are lapped over them, half running to the top of the wall and the other half to middepth. Actually, a much more refined design can be made that involves more cutting of bars. For such a design, a diagram comparing the theoretical steel area required at various elevations in the stem and the actual steel furnished is very useful. It is to be remembered (ACI Code 12.10.3) that the bars cut off must run at least a distance *d* or 12 diameters beyond their theoretical cutoff points and must also meet the necessary development length requirements.

### **13.11 Cracks and Wall Joints**

Objectionable horizontal cracks are rare in retaining walls because the compression faces are the ones that are visible. When they do occur, it is usually a sign of an unsatisfactory structural design and not shrinkage. In Chapter 6 of this book, the ACI procedure (Section 10.6) for limiting crack sizes in tensile zones of one-way beams and slabs was presented. These provisions may be applied to vertical retaining wall steel. However, they are usually thought unnecessary because the vertical steel is on the earth side of the wall.

Vertical cracks in walls, however, are quite common unless sufficient construction joints are used. Vertical cracks are related to the relief of tension stresses because of shrinkage, with the resulting tensile forces exceeding the longitudinal steel capacity.

Construction joints may be used both horizontally and vertically between successive pours of concrete. The surface of the hardened concrete can be cleaned and roughened, or keys can be used as shown in Figure 13.28(a) to form horizontal construction joints.

If concrete is restrained from free movement when shrinking—for example, by being attached to more rigid parts of the structure—it will crack at points of weakness. Contraction joints are weakened places constructed so that shrinkage failures will occur at prepared locations. When the shrinkage tensile stresses become too large, they will pull these contraction

**FI GU RE 13.28** Examples of construction joints.

joints apart and form neat cracks rather than the crooked, unsightly ones that might otherwise occur. In addition to handling shrinkage problems, contraction joints are useful in handling differential settlements. They need to be spaced at intervals about 25 ft on center (the AASHTO says not greater than 30 ft). The joints are usually constructed with rubber strips that are left in place or with wood strips that are later removed and replaced with caulking.

Expansion joints are vertical joints that completely separate the different parts of a wall. They are placed approximately 50 ft to 100 ft on centers (the AASHTO says maximum spacing should not be greater than 90 ft). Reinforcing bars are generally run through all joints so that vertical and horizontal alignment is maintained. When the bars do run through a joint, one end of the bars on one side of the joint is either greased or sheathed so that the desired expansion can take place.

![](_page_444_Picture_6.jpeg)

Box culvert.

It is difficult to estimate the amount of shrinkage or expansion of a particular wall because the wall must slide on the soil beneath, and the resulting frictional resistance may be sufficient so that movement will be greatly reduced or even prevented. A rough value for the width of an expansion joint can be determined from the following expression, in which *L* is the change in length, *L* is the distance between joints, *T* is the estimated temperature change, and 0.000005 per unit length per degree Fahrenheit is the estimated coefficient of contraction of the wall.

$$\Delta L = (0.000005L) (\Delta T)$$
