# Glossary

- **Aggregate interlock** Shear or friction resistance by the concrete on opposite sides of a crack in a reinforced concrete member (obviously larger with narrower cracks).
- **Balanced failure condition** The simultaneous occurrence of the crushing of the compression concrete on one side of a member and the yielding of the tensile steel on the other side.
- **Bond stresses** The shear-type stresses produced on the surfaces of reinforcing bars as the concrete tries to slip on those bars.
- **Camber** The construction of a member bent or arched in one direction so that it won't look so bad when the service loads bend it in the opposite direction.
- **Capacity reduction factors** Factors that take into account the uncertainties of material strengths, approximations in analysis, and variations in dimensions and workmanship. They are multiplied by the nominal or theoretical strengths of members to obtain their permissible strengths.
- **Cast-in-place concrete** Concrete cast at the building site in its final position.
- **Column capital** A flaring or enlarging of a column underneath a reinforced concrete slab.
- **Composite column** A concrete column that is reinforced longitudinally with structural steel shapes.
- **Compression reinforcement** Reinforcement added to the compression side of beams to increase moment capacity, increase ductility, decrease long-term deflections, or provide hangars for shear reinforcement.
- **Concrete** A mixture of sand, gravel, crushed rock, or other aggregates held together in a rock-like mass with a paste of cement and water.

- **Cracking moment** The bending moment in a member when the concrete tensile stress equals the modulus of rupture and cracks begin to occur.
- **Creep or plastic flow** When a concrete member is subjected to sustained compression loads, it will continue to shorten for years. The shortening that occurs after the initial or instantaneous shortening is called *creep* or *plastic flow* and is caused by the squeezing of water from the pores of the concrete.
- **Dead load** Loads of constant magnitude that remain in one position. Examples: weights of walls, floors, roofs, plumbing, fixtures, structural frames, and so on.

- **Drop panels** A thickening of a reinforced concrete slab around a column.
- **Effective depth** The distance from the compression face of a flexural member to the center of gravity of the tensile reinforcing.
- **Factored load** A load that has been multiplied by a load factor, thus providing a safety factor.

**One-way slab** A slab designed to bend in one direction.

**Overreinforced members** Members for which the tensile steel will not yield (nor will cracks and deflections appreciably change) before failure, which will be sudden and without warning due to crushing of the compression concrete.

**Ready-mixed concrete** Concrete that is mixed at a concrete plant and then is transported to the construction site.

**Reinforced concrete** A combination of concrete and steel reinforcing wherein the steel provides the tensile strength lacking in the concrete. (The steel reinforcing can also be used to resist compressive forces.)

**Secondary moments** Moments caused in a structure by its deformations under load. As a column bends laterally, a moment is caused equal to the axial load times the lateral deformation. It is called a *secondary* or *P-*δ *moment*.

**Seismic Design Category** A classification given to a structure based on its Occupancy Category and the severity of the design earthquake ground motion at the site.

**Serviceability** Pertains to the performance of structures under normal service loads and is concerned with such items as deflections, vibrations, cracking, and slipping.

**Short columns** Columns with such small slenderness ratios that secondary moments are negligible.

**Two-way slabs** Floor or roof slabs supported by columns or walls arranged so that the slab bends in two directions.

**Underreinforced member** A member that is designed so that the tensile steel will begin to yield (resulting in appreciable deflections and large visible cracks) while the compression concrete has not yet reached its limiting compressive strain. Thus, a warning is provided before failure occurs.

**Working loads** The actual loads that are assumed to be applied to a structure when it is in service (also called *service loads*).

**Working-stress design** A method of design where the members of a structure are so proportioned that the estimated dead and live loads do not cause elastically computed stresses to exceed certain specified values. Method is also referred to as *allowable stress design, elastic design*, or *service load design*.
